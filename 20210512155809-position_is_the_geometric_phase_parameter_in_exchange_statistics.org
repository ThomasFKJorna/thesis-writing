* The relevant parameter for the geometric phase is position in exchange statistics

The [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]] arises when you vary the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the system slowly from and back to their original starting point, tracing out a path in parameter space.

The relevant parameter could be anything, cite:Tong2016 uses magnetic strenght as a parameter at some point.
For my thesis, however, I am interested in [[file:20210316143742-quantum_statistics.org][Quantum Statistics]] which arise when two particles are /physically/ exchanged. So the relevant parameter I am looking at when studying  [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][Anyons]] is just position, which is easy to think about (in some sense).
