#+title: the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional
#+filetags: FQHE


The Quantum Hall Effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at multiples of the [[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]] $R_H=h/(e^2*\nu)$  in the transversal and longitudinal resitances measured in the[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][ classical hall effect]].

This can be observed in this graph.

The QHE has two variations, which occur for very different reasons.

* [[file:20210219125447-the_integer_quantum_hall_effect_iqhe.org][the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]]

The integer quantum hall effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at integer multiples of the quantum of resistance.

* [[file:20210219125155-the_fractional_quantum_hall_effect_fqhe.org][the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]]

The fractional quantum hall effect is the observation of similar, but usually more subtle plateaux and valleys at (simple) fractional multiples of the quantum of resistance.
