The Quantum Hall Effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at multiples of the [[id:96aec7c9-c31b-48da-9872-2690b057e7ca][quantum of resistance]] $R_H=h/(e^2*\nu)$  in the transversal and longitudinal resitances measured in the[[id:8fc72829-7ad9-4c8a-b400-229add0957bb][classical hall effect]].

The QHE has two variations, which occur for very different reasons.

* [[id:c936a9ab-092e-4fe3-8b96-b6f4ae91e583][the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]]

The integer quantum hall effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at integer multiples of the quantum of resistance.

* [[id:2fa90488-38aa-478f-bc3a-2290fb9def10][the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]]

The fractional quantum hall effect is the observation of similar, but usually more subtle plateaux and valleys at (simple) fractional multiples of the quantum of resistance.
