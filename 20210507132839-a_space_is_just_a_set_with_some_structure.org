* A space is just a set with some structure

The word *space* in mathematics always confused me, but I think that you can think of a space as just a [[file:20210505153858-set.org][Set]] with some structure.

Examples are [[file:20210403182645-topological_space.org][Topological space]]s, which are just sets with a topology structure defined on them, [[file:20210416111039-metric_space.org][Metric Space]]s, which are just sets with a [[file:20210507133134-vector_space.org][Vector space]] and metric defined on it, etc etc.

This reassures me.
