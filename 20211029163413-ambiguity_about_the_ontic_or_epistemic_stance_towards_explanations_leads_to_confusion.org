#+title: Ambiguity about the ontic or epistemic stance towards explanations leads to confusion
#+filetags: :explanation:

When discussing explanations, philosophers often do not explicitly state whether they think of explanations as ontic or epistemic, because they either assume everyone shares their position or because they maybe just aren't great at communicating.
