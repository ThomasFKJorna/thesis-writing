# Metric

A **metric**, as physicists use it, is something, usually a matrix, which rather globally indicates how distances are to measured.

It differs from the metric in [[Metric Space]], as it by itself does not indicate distance. It needs to be combined with a distance function, usually [[Proper time]]
