[[Monodromy]], the thing that happens when 'something' (like a vector) travels around a singularity, can be seen as an [[Infinite Idealizations|infinite idealization]] of what happens to the [[Holonomy]] of that things traveling the same path when the curvature of a surface gets flatter (into a singularity)

The main example I have here is that of [[Limit of the cone holonomy]]
