* Impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized

[[./media/breakdegen.png]]

Impurities in the sample are modeled as a random potential. This random potential first ensures that [[id:5ef0b428-994c-4b5b-bf8f-c8b2491baf24][impurities break the degeneracy of the landau levels]] by broadening them, but secondly they "cut up" the quantum states of the system into extended and localized states. Extended states "extend" throughout the whole system, while localized states do not.
