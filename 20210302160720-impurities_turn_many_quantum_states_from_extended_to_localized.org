* Impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized

[[./media/breakdegen.png]]

Impurities in the sample are modeled as a random potential. This random potential first ensures that [[file:20210302155202-impurities_break_the_degeneracy_of_the_landau_levels.org][impurities break the degeneracy of the landau levels]] by broadening them, but secondly they "cut up" the quantum states of the system into extended and localized states. Extended states "extend" throughout the whole system, while localized states do not.
