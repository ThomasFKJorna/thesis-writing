# Derivation of Landau Levels for QHE

The [[the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]] and the [[the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]]'s energy levels are derived as follows (roughly)

Start with the [[general Hamiltonian for a free particle in a magnetic field]]

$H=\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}+e\mathbf{\hat{A}})^2$

where $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{A}$ are of course the [[quantum operators]] of momentum and the Gauge field respectively.

Since the particles in the Hall effect are restricted to lie in a plane  $\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$.
Since the magnetic field is constant and perpendicular to the plane  $\nabla\times \mathbf{\vec{A}}=B\mathbf{\hat{z}}$

From this we derive the [[canonical commutation relation]]$$
[\hat{x_i},\hat{p_j}]=i\hbar\delta_{ij}
$$
