# Context

Whilst working on my thesis I occasionally come across things I cannot quite seem to answer. I want to keep track of those here, and possibly incorporate these into my agenda/actionables through a shortcut.

# Questions

## OPEN Is localized vs extended a sensible dichotomy? #IQHE

See [[impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized]]_Asked On_

## OPEN Why do [[extended states conduct more when less populated]] #IQHE

_Asked On_

## CLOSED Why iqhe so weird #IQHE

_Asked On_

## OPEN  [[is the neglection of electron interactions in IQHE justified?]]



## CLOSED why is $R_i R_{i+1} R_i = R_{i+1} R_i R_{i+1}$ ?



## OPEN Is "the worldlines not getting entangled" not enough of an explanation for anyons? Do particles need to be 2D in order for there worldlines to get tangly?



## OPEN Do anyons _always_ occur at partially filled Landau levels?



## CLOSED [[where does the hole WF come from?]]



## OPEN How important is the fact that worldlines are unintertwinable to FQS arising?



## OPEN (difficult) How can a states go from unquantized to quantized under the influence of an magnetic field at all? This is the more fundamental difficulty



## OPEN Is the FQHE Toy Hamiltonian derived from the LWF or the other way around, like Ronnie suggested? The latter seems more plausible but I think it is actually the former



## CLOSED Why does being able to continuously connect the spacetime path to the situation where the paricles dont moce at all imply that the state is  "the same" as not rotating at all?



## CLOSED there seems to be an argument against my take on 3D fractional stats being possible. However, this relies on spin, which we are neglecting? Otherwise i think quasiholes have fractional spin anyway. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93statistics_theorem



# Unadressed issues

## OPEN Is "universality" something important? How do I deal with that "loss" of explanation?
