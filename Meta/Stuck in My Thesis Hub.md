# Stuck in My Thesis Hub

This meta note is here in order to get me back on track when I forget what my thesis is about and what the hell I'm doing even.

# This is what you are interested in:

[[Transitions from continuity to the discrete are not possible]]

# These are good points you made you keep forgetting

[[Infinite idealizations resemble Sorites because both have discontinuous transitions|inf id are similar to sorites because both have disc trans]]

[[The Discretization of Quantum States is the biggest discontinuity in physics]]

# This is good advice you or someone else gave you that is worth recapping

[[if you cant loop back to your introduction, make shit up in your conclusion]]

\#+transclud\_ t[[writing sucks, that's why you should do it]]
