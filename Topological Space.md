# Topological Space

## Munkres

A **topological space** is an ordered pair $(X, T)$ consiisting of any set $X$ which has a [[Topology]] $T$ specified on it.

This is similar to the idea of a [[Metric Space]], except instead of defining a metric you define a topology.

### With open sets

A **topological space** $X$ is a set $X$ together with a collection of subsets of $X$, called  [[Open set]]s, such that

1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open
2) Arbitrary _unions_ of open subsets of $X$ are also open
3) Arbitrary _intersections_ of open subsets of $X$ are also open
