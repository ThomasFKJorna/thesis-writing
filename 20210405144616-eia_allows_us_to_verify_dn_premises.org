#+title: EIA allows us to verify DN premises
#+filetags: EIA explanation

* The EIA allows uh to verify DN premises

[[id:b93fa016-999a-4f1a-a471-8c631db1879a][The deductive-nomological model of explanation]] is like
1. True events
2. True law of nature
C. Prediction of event.

Thus, C is explained by 1 \and 2.

What EIA does is look at DN and make up a story that allows us to predict C, then says "1 and 2 are true because they explain C". This is weird.
