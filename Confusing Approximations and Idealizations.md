# Confusing Approximations and Idealizations

 While Norton attempts to clear up this distinction, it is usually not so straightforward to distinguish between the two, because idealizations are extremely prevalent (especially in physics)

 Idealizations are often taken to already be the approximation, which leads people to forget that what we are interested in is the actual target system, not the idealization

## This is how that goes wrong-

1) Make an approximation (say f<sub>air</sub>=0)
2) The approximation becomes so universally used that a model which leads to it (i.e. the model we would obtain after [[Promotion of Approximations|promoting the approximation]]) gets taken as the model under study, e.g. f<sub>air</sub>=0 -> world without atmosphere
3) Some other property that's relevant to study arises, for which it is useful to use the same approximation. Imagine for instance that instead of wanting to "just" know the velocity of a falling object, we turn to examining gravitational effects in general.
4) Instead of the approximation, the idealization gets used since it's so common place
5) The idealization has properties which lead to incorrect predictions and thus perhaps to inaccurate theories *because* we are using the current model.
6) The prediction of the model are taken as accurate, while the model itself is based on very inaccurate assumptions


Another aspect that makes this difficult is that it is not always clear what is the relevant property, see
