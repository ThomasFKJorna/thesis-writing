# confusing approximations and idealizations

# Thought

## While Norton attempts to clear up this distinction, it is usually not so straightforward to distinguish between the two, because idealizations are extremely prevalent (especially in physics)

### Idealizations are often taken to already be the approximation, which leads people to forget that what we are interested in is the actual target system, not the idealization

### This is how that goes wrong-

1) Make an approximation (say f<sub>air</sub>=0)
2) The approximation becomes so apparent that a model which leads to it gets taken as the model under study, e.g. f<sub>air</sub>=0 -> world without atmosphere
3) Some other property that's relevant to study arises, for which it is useful to take use the same approximation, e.g. we want to find out how quickly a falling meteorite would burn up the earth
4) Instead of the approximation, the idealization gets used since it's so common place
5) The idealization has properties which lead to incorrect predictions, here having no air would help calculate the trajectory of the meteorite, but not provide a correct picture of the amount of heat radiated, as that is dependent on the amount of air in the atmosphere
6) The prediction of the model are taken as accurate, while the model itself is based on very inaccurate assumptions

### TODO Find better example

## Another aspect that makes this difficult is that it is not always clear what is the relevant property, see
