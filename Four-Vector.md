# Four-vector

A **four-vector** is vector-form often used in [[Special Relativity|relativistic]] physics, defined as

where $x_0$ is often time or a time-relevant quantity such as energy.

The lenght of a four vector is

where $\eta$ is the [[Minkowski Metric]].

The most common four vector is the proper time $\tau$, whose length is the invariant quantity in special relativity.
