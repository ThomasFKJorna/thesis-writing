#+title: Shech's argument for FQHE Requires EXACT 2D
#+roam_tags: FQHE

* Shech's argument (as I see it) for why the FQHE (or more specifically the observation of FQ stats) requires the configuration space of electrons to be exactly 2D

1. FQHE shows/is compatible with/makes plausible the existence of [[file:20210218152830-fractional_quantum_statistics_is_the_study_of_anyons.org][fractional quantum statistics is the study of anyons]], i.e. the particles having an exchange factor of $e^{i2\pi\alpha}\quad \alpha\neq 0,1$
2. The quantum statistics of a particle is determined by the 1D representation of its [[file:20210218153905-fundamental_group.org][fundamental group]]
3. The 1D representation of [[file:20210218154017-braid_group.org][braid group]] is $e^{i2\pi\alpha}\quad\alpha\neq0,1$
4. The Braid group is the fundamental group /only/ of exchange in 2D space, as worldlines get entangled then.
$\therefore$ In order to explain anyons/FQHE, the configuration space of the electrons needs to be /exactly/ 2D, not small 3D.
