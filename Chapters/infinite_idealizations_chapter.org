* On Idealizations

** Idealization is the important feature of models in my interest

As mentioned previously, instead of focusing on the general process of abstraction by examining the relation between physical models and "reality", I will turn my gaze to a specific feature of the practice of modeling which, as I will argue, best exemplifies the problems with drawing boundaries: idealization.

** What is idealization

For the purposes at hand, identifying all the necessary and sufficient conditions counting something as an idealization is slight overkill, notwithstanding the general difficulty with such identifications. Instead, it is sufficient to focus on one necessary feature of idealizations: they /falsely/ represent one or more features of the real world in order to ease calculation or reasoning (are these all the things people do with models? reasoning is pretty broad so should be safe). This mirrors the major issue with boundary drawing/discretization, namely that some boundary is drawn in order to facilitate reasoning about some object or concept, when identifying or justifying that boundary is difficult. The shared difficulty, then, consists in justifying either the use or reality of such simplifications.

However, common descripitions/(word) of idealization specifically include the fact that they introduce a /false/ description, which is not something we ought to assume about the boundary drawing problem, as doing so would beg the question. Instead we will take the by now familiar stance of examining /how, if at all/ the use or legitimacy of idealizations is justified, and hopefully extrapolate from there.

*** Characterizations of idealization?

Characterizations of idealizations are abound in the literature, although few dare claim to provide an exhaustive one. The most discussed are cite:Norton2012 's characterization of idealization as opposed to approximation:
- Approximation: proposition which sort of describes the target
- Idealization: model whose properties sort of describe the target

Norton's standard example is a ball falling through the atmosphere. We have an excellent formula for calculating the velocity $v(t)$ starting at $v=t=0$ as
\[
v(t)=\frac{g}{k}(1-\exp(-kt))=gt-\frac{gkt^2}{2}+\frac{gk^2t^3}{6}-\ldots
\]
where $g$ is the accelaration due to gravity, and $k$ a friction coefficient.

As any physics student knows, it is often convenient to leave out the influence of air resistance. Setting $k=0$ gives us
\[
v(t)=gt
\]

Given Norton's distinction, we can look at the above formula in two ways, either as an approximation or as an idealization. If we view it as an approximation i.e. a proposition describing the actual system inexactly, we can say that this is a good approximation for the first part of the ball's descent, becoming a worse and worse approximation as the ball continues to fall. We could also view it as an idealization, in which case we view the above equation as representing a (false) model of a ball falling in a vacuum. It is not the description of this model that is false, rather the model (idealization) misrepresents our world in some way, namely by leaving out air.

In this example the differnce between an approximation and an idealization is simply a point of view: we can freely shift the characterization of the formula as an approximation or idealization. The "shifting" Norton calls promotion and demotion respectively. Promotion consists in taking the approximation to describe a new, idealized model, while demotion is extracting one or more inexact propositions from an existing idealization.  I mention this now because it will come in handy later.

Other descriptions are due to cite:Strevens2007, which characterizes idealizations more similarly to how I did above, as deliberate falsifications of reality. Specifically, Strevens conceptualizes idealizations in terms of the operation behind them: setting a parameter to zero, infinity, or some other number.

*** Why do we not consider the target system an idealization? It's also a model

*** Is idealization different than abstraction?

** Not focus on idealizations as a whole but on infinite idealizations

As is tradition by now, I wish to focus on a subsection of idealizations first in order to get a better grasp on them. Idealization as construed above does not differ that much from a model, indeed Norton even seems to treat them as synonyms. Analyzing models on their own is difficult, and since idealizations are difficult to distinguish from models entirely, analyizing idealizations on their own will in all likelihood also turn out to be difficult. Therefore let us turn to a more problematic example of idealization, one which has more easily identifiable examples: infinite idealizations.

Infinite idealizations (also called "asymptotic idealizations" by for instance cite:Strevens2019 or "asymptotic explanation" by for instance cite:Batterman2005) are, put crudely, an idealization which is arrived at through some sort of limiting operation, through which a parameter of the original model is made to approach infinity[fn:infinitesimal]. Commonly discussed examples in the literature are the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), the Aharanov Bohm effect, infinite population models ....

As promised, infinite idealizations run into more obvious problems more quickly: in the thermodynamic limit the number of particles goes to infinity, the FQHE posits 2D particles, the AB effect requires an infinitely long solenoid and in order to explain gene distribuitions biologists assume infinite populations. /Prima facie/, the problem appears straightforward: such things do not exist. "Can you show me an infinitely long solenoid?", the detractor exclaims. However, why does this appear so problematic? After all, was intentional misrepresentation not the characterizing feature of idealizations? Why is setting air resistance to $0$ less problematic than setting the $z$-axis to $0$?

...

** Characterizations of infinite idealizations
 (This is the important part, where everything before this is more an idea of how I would fit it in the rest of my thesis)
*** Norton

First in cite:Norton2012 and more in depth in cite:Norton2014, Norton describes his unease with so called "infinite idealizations". Although never providing a strict definition, we can make an educated guess to one:

*Infinite Idealization (Norton):*

An infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on an idealized system, taking some parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity. The infinite idealization is the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity. However, sometimes these systems misbehave by either the limit not obtaining or conflicting, which is bad.

This characterization somewhat goes against the limit of what Norton intends to argue, namely that such infinite idealizations are not idealizations at all, but can only be sensibly understood as /approximations/ as defined above. For "the essential starting point of the notion of idealization is that we have a consistently describably system, even if it is fictitious."cite:Norton2014 pp. 200   However, I am not willing to grant that condition just yet, so for now we will refer to these systems as infinite idealizations.

Norton furthermore distinguishes between well-behaved and ill-behaved idealizations.[fn:well-behaved] Ill-behaved idealizations are infinite idealizations whose limit system (the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity) does not match with target system in some way. This mismatch can take two forms cite:Norton2012 (3.2, 3.3): the limit system might not exist, e.g. an infinite sphere, or the limit system might have a property which conflicts with a property of the target system. For the former, if we define a sphere as all points which are equidistant from some other point, then an infinite sphere does not exist, as there are no points at infinity. ($\mathbb{R}=(-\infty, \infty)$ not tt$[-\infty,\infty]$) For the latter, Norton imagines modelling an arbitarily long ellipsoid as an infinite cylinder. While they look similar, the ratio of surface to volume for an ellipsoid is different than that for a cylinder, so the idealization has a fundamental mismatch.

In short: for Norton infinite idealization simply is the end result of the process of a limiting operation. Furthermore, these idealizations can sometimes be well behaved, and sometimes ill-behaved.

*** Strevens

cite:Strevens2019a defines infinity (or "asymptotic" as he likes to call it, we will stick with infinite here) idealizations slightly differently than Norton. Luckily, Strevens does provide a clear definition, which is in contrast to what he calls a "simple" idealization, which "is ahieved by the straightforward operation of setting some parameter or parameters in the model to non-actual values, often zero". A clear example is the air-resistance coeffient above. At first, he constrast this straightforwardly with infinite idealizations in the Norton sense, as "in asymptotic idealization, by contrast, a fiction is introduced by taking some sort of limit". This definition can be taken to be identical with Norton's.

However, later on in the paper he adds an additional layer to the definition, (TODO find a good quote for this) namely that infinite idealizations are made when it is not possible to use a simple idealization to directly the relevant property to zero (or infinity). Furthermore, he adds, "Asymptotic idealization is an interesting proposition, then, only in those cases where a simple substitution cannot be performed, which is to say only in those cases where a veridical model for mathematical reasons falls apart or otherwise behaves badly at the limiting value." While Strevens later argues why these interesting cases (Norton's mismatches) /do/ make sense, we do not have to concern us with evaluating that just yet, we simply need to note that Strevens makes the same distinction as Norton here. Then, we can define

*Infinite Idealization (Strevens):*

An infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on a system, taking some "extrapolation" parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity *in order to set some other parameter to zero or infinity.* The infinite idealization is the system with the extrapolation parameter and the relevant paramenter set to either zero or infinity (dont' need to be the same). However, sometimes these systems misbehave, *which is interesting*.
(bold to highlight differences with Norton)

Batterman also has some definition but it is rather vague.

** Why this is confusing

I am not satisfied with definitions, as they contain too many different relevant pieces of information such as whether they misbehave, how they do the operation and what kind of subset they form of idealizations in general. I believe that the discussion of infinite idealization would be much clearer if we distinguished between the factors that contribute to the problem, as follows.

** A Categorization of Idealization

Focusing on the discussion of infinite idealizations solely, I believe 4 (maybe 5) distinctions can be drawn. I will first present the distinctions, and then show how I believe they are ordered. The goal is to create categories for (infinite) idealizations to facilitate reasoning and argument, since, as we have seen above, Norton and Strevens are not per se arguing over the same definition, even if it is close.

*** Simple vs. Infinite Idealizations

In Strevens and less explicitly in Norton, the discussion is presented as being about this distinction, but actually concerns a subclass of infinite idealizations we shall discuss below. However, the simple vs. infinite distinction is a useful one, but I will draw it differently than Strevens.
a) /Simple Idealization/.
    A simple idealization is an idealization in which no limit is taken in order to set the relevant parameter.
b) /Infinite Idealization/.
   An infinite idealization is one in which a limit is taken in order to set a parameter.

Note that no reference has been made to whether or not it affects another parameter, or whether the limit operation is succesful. I argue that this is first and foremost the distinction between these idealizations, and that other qualities should be discussed separately. (I am not sure whether idealizations can be split up neatly into two disjoint sets like these (I'm not sure if that can be done at all, see cite:WEBER2010 ), but i'll just treat it like it does)

This is a distinction based on /method/: /how/ is the idealization achieved? The idealized system might end up the same in some cases, but the operation is the relevant piece.

*** Direct vs. Indirect Idealizations

This distinction is also due to Strevens, although he does not discuss it separately and makes it co-refering(?) with the first distinction. Direct idealizations, as the name implies, directly alter the relevant parameter e.g. setting air resitance to zero in order to have zero air resistance.  Indirect idealizations on the other hand, alter a parameter in order to alter the actually relevant parameter, e.g. infinite population in order to set genetic drift to zero, or infinite particles in order to achieve a singularity.

This is a distinction based on /goal/: /what/ should the idealization achieve? Indirect idealizations are sometimes necessary in order to get rid of a pesky parameter. Note that while this is an intention based distinction, in some models the same parameter might be set directly or indirectly. While in Newtonian Mechanics we might set the air resistance to zero directly, in a more complete QFT description of the same situation we have no access to such a parameter.

Also note that this distinction is not the same as the one between infinite and simple idealizations: as Strevens notes, it is completely in the realm of possibility to directly set a parameter to zero using an infinite limiting operation, "but you would merely be showing off."

Additionally, only infinite ideazations can be indirect, but not all are.

*** Unproblematic/boring vs. problematic/interesting

(not sure what to call this yet, should be catchy)
This distinction is both due to Strevens and Norton, and is what I believe the main distinction we ought to discuss. This distinction is only relevant for *indirect infinite* idealizations, as both Norton and Strevens agree that all direct and simple idealizations provide little puzzlement. Indirect infinite idealizations can be boring i.e. there is no mismatch with the idealized system and the target system (I have no example), or interesting, by creating such a mismatch. All the idealizations under discussion fall under this category.

This is a distinction based on /result/: /what/ is the idealization like? (Not too sure about this characterization, not very catchy)

*** Absent vs. Contradictory

(also unsure about these names) (other idea self-contradictory and "external"-contradictory? extracontradictory?)
This distinction is due to Norton, as Strevens does not explicitly distinguish between the two. This distinction only concerns *interesting idealizations*. For absent idealizations, the idealized model system simply cannot exist in its own terms: an infinite sphere does not denote anything. Contradictory idealizations, on the other hand, postulate some property of the model system which conficts with another property we hold to be incontrovertible, or at least uncontroversial. Most of the idealizations under discussion fall under this category: infinite populations are not self contradictory, but they prevent probabilistic reasoning using uniform distributions.

This is a distinction based on ???

*** Putative distinctions

There are two more distinctions of which I am not sure I can genuinely draw them.

**** Quantitative vs qualitative mismatch/contradiction.
- Quantitative
  Here I mean Norton's ellipsoid elongating to a cylinder: the mismatch comes from the ellipsoid having a certain volume/surface ratio in all finite stages, but a different one when infinitely long. No property is set to zero or infinity, unless you count "cylinderness".
- Qualitative
  Some property becomes true or false in the infinite limit which is not false or true in the finite case. Most of the actual examples are here: having or not having phase transitions, being 2D or 3D, exhibiting or not exhibiting an effect

  The reason I doubt this distinction is because I feel like it's a question of framing. A very important question, which I should investigate, but not a distinction of kind per se.

**** Logical/transcendental contradiction vs a physical/intuitive contradiction.

The former is exemplified by Streven's infinite population example: the main problem is that for an infinite population it is no longer possible to have countable additivity with a uniform distribution, and so you cannot use the Strong Law of Large Numbers and could not say anything about the probability of genetic drift (might be badly paraphrasing): the method itself is no longer useful, but it's not a direct self-contradiction as the infinite sphere, as an infinite population is a sensible concept. The latter is a bit more vague, but here I mean e.g. the thermodynamic limit: it does not work because it stipulates an inifite number of particles. However, this is in conflict with the whole idea that the world is made up of molecules. BUT not directly so, as cite:Shech2013 points out, it is only a real paradox if we stipulate that statistical mechanics in the thermodynamic limit is a true/accurate representaiton of the world, which we need to justify by e.g. (or i.e.? I don't know of any others) an indispensability argument.

This is a distinction based on????

I doubt this because the former category might refer to the same as "absent" idealizations.

** Order of the distinctions

I think the order is best explained by this beautiful diagram, the whole box being "idealization-space". Not included is how this is linked to approximations, nor the distinctions I am unsure about, this is simply to show how the above distinctions work:

[[../HPS/Thesis/Beautiful_Images/idealization_distinctions.png]]

** Discussion


While these distinctions might appear nitpicky, I think they are vital for making sure we are discussing the correct problem. Additionally, in making these distinctions it became clear that perhaps more distinctions need to be made, such as the specific nature of the contradiction induced, see Section \ref{sec:orgff730de}.

What is clear is how infinite idealizations (the interesting ones at least) differ from idealizations in general or simple ones. Infinite idealizations are a subcategory of idealizations, together with simple idealizations (whether they completely fill the category of idealization is left open). However, the distinction between infinite idealizations and simple idealizations does not prove particularly enlightening. Other distinctions will be more fruitful to investigate. I do not think this warrants a change in nomenclature per se, as there is substantial literature on infinite idealizations already. Clarification would be in order though.
