## What is the importance of the 2D idealization for the FQHE

The quantum hall effect has also been studied in three dimensions, see [@Torres2020;@Tang2019;@Pavlosiuk2017].

Apparently it is not as straightforward as I thought, people have constructed the 3D fractional quantum hall effect, but it's rather difficult.

The difference-maker for whether an electron gas is 2D seems to be it's Fermi-surface topology.[[3D Quantum Hall Effect]]
