# 2. Topology and Anyons

In a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2} , ... )$  and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why _do_ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in mhe standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both_indistinguishable_ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is _how_ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?

As a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\psi_{i}$ 

$$\Psi_0=\psi_a(x_1)\psi_b(x_2)$$

Now, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle$x_1$ is in state $\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\psi_i$ to be mean something like "having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\Psi_0$. To denote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (=rotating by 360 degrees) is 
$\psi_{2\pi}=P^2\psi_0=1\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchange system, we find:

$$\psi_{\pi}=P\psi_0=\sqrt{1}\psi_0=\pm 1\psi_0$$

This yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[^1]

The above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete.

The way to define what we mean by "exchange*ability*". To start, the suggestively italicized _ability_ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the _possible_ ways a particle _is able to be_ exchanged is of central importance.
One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the _configuration space_ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[^2] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be _the same_, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a _geometric_ or _topological_ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.

The main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of _homotopy equivalence_, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from_geometric_ path equivalence: there paths are only "the same" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be `isomorphic`. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.

Returning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the _explanation_ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the _geometry_. Here we will first discuss the topological argument,
after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.

By focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the _space_. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its **connectedness**. A space is called **simply connected** iff all _loops_ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness.

For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that "pierces" the space: the handle in the "space" of a coffeecup and the hole in the "space" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as "holes" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called _multiply-connected_, or sometimes more simply _non-simply-connected_ spaces.

This concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2 if the space is simply connected, because "being the same" means "being the same path" and "being the same path" means "being able to continuously deform them to each other" and "doing nothing" is the "point path" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\mathbb{R}^3$, but _not_ in$\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.

### Phase

Much of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the _phase_ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.

Phase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the "phase factor" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in _complex_ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$
away is not $\pm 1$, but $e^{i\theta}$, as that simply _is_ the square root of $1$ in$\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\theta}\quad\forall\theta\in \mathbb{R}$

It is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-_independent_ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would `xxxxxxxxxx`
then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.

Thus while phases do not appear to matter _prima faciae_, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).


## The configuration space explanation for anyons

The topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:

1) Construct the _configuration space_ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.
2) Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the
   _fundamental group_ of the space.
3) Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.

We will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.

### The 3D case

#### Constructing the configuration space

Our first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$
identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for
$N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be

$$\mathbb{R}^d_1 \times \mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \times \mathbb{R}^d_N$$

We shall for now focus on just two particles in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles $\mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$
As we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.

To simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\mathbf{R}=\frac{(\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of$(\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{r})$ is still $\mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable,
therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter
(we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two$\mathbb{R}^3$ s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[^3] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.

Let us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by "dividing out" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[^4] yielding $\frac{\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}$

    * This heading seems kinda relevant, but I don't know where to put it
    * labels: clarification
    * milestones: 
    */}
 

#### If we view the configuration space not as separate particles but two coordinates of some system, CM & Distance, than the configuration space is much easier to visualize

#### Missing points are hard to justify usually begs the question (maybe make an argument out of this.)

The second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for _why_ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as expressed by `SOURCES`, tends to justifying the exclusion of these diagonal points by noting that this configuration space needs to account for fermions, which are subject to the Pauli-exclusion principle and thus cannot intersect. However, this argument presupposes the Pauli-exclusion principle and fermions as a distinct category of particles,
which precisely follow from this very argument! The justification clearly begs the question, but this does not appear to bother most. Some attempts have been made to provide a better justification, for instance using the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory @Brown1999, but such interpretations have not found their way into the mainstream discussion on anyons. For now we shall follow the herd and accept the excision of the diagonal points from the configuration space, and shall return to such issues later.

Returning back to the configuration space, it appears we have no other choice than to excise the points representing the particles occupying the same space from our configuration space, denoted by $\Delta$. In the $(\mathbf{r_1, r_2})$ representation, $\Delta$ consists of the diagonal of points$\mathbf{r_1}=\mathbf{r_2}$, such as $(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{0})$, $(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1})$ etc. In our current CM/distance representation, in which we only focus on the distance part $\frac{\mathbb{R}^3}{S_2}$, this amount to only excising single point at the origin, so $\Delta=\{\mathbf{0}\}$. Now we are finally able to write down the full configuration space $Q$

$$Q=\mathbb{R}^d \times \frac{\mathbb{R}^d -\Delta}{S_2}$$

of which we will only be studying the latter half $Q'$, e.g.

$$Q'=\frac{\mathbb{R}^d - \{\mathbf{0}\}}{S_2}$$

Finally we are able to make some clever remarks about the structure of the configuration space, starting (and ultimately ending) with its _connectedness_. As mentioned previously, as space is called _simply connected_ if, roughly, no holes pierce it. To placate the more mathematically oriented reader and be more precise, a space is called simply connected if it contains no non-trivial loops, meaning that all paths looping back around to itself (a loop) are _homotopy equivalent_ to a point, meaning that we are able to smoothly "close the loop" without it "snagging" behind a point somewhere. The "are able to" does a lot of work here: if there is even _a single_ way to contract the path to point we consider it possible to do so and therefore the _whole_ space simply-connected.

The difference of course, is that your rivals finger does not prevent _all_ paths to be contracted to a point, whereas the infinitely long cylinder does.

Returning back our example of two indistinguishable particles in three dimensions, we can visualize $Q'$ more easily if we restrict the distance between the particles by for instance setting$\mathbf{r}=|\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2}|=1$ . The resulting space can be described in a number of different ways, and is called the _real projective plane_$RP^2$. You can visualize it as:

1) A sphere of radius 1 with all of its antipodal (points which oppose one another, like the North and South pole) identified (being taken as the same point).
2) The space of all possible lines of length 1 through the origin.
3) A hemisphere which behaves strangely at the boundary
4) A mobius band which also has its "sides" glued together in the same way a regular mobius band is constructed, namely by twisting it once.

{/** TODO: Figure out a better name for loop naming conventions than "half-exchange" and "full-exchange" 
    * 
    * labels: terminology
    */}
 

In our "one-particle-at-the-origin" picture, we can roughly see the points in$RP2$ corresponding with one particle circling the other, with one crucial caveat: when we move particle 2 halfway around the other, performing in effect a
"half exchange," we return back to the same point, as the particles are indistinguishable from one another and we do not care about where their center of mass lies.

Now we finally, decisively determine the connectedness of this space. It turns out that there are two different possible loops around this "circle", loops again being paths that return to their starting position: one fully going around the "sphere" and one going halfway around it. This space is _not_ simply-connected, but not in a very complicated manner. The only path which is not "shrinkable" to a point is the halfway exchange path, because the only way for particle 2 to complete this loop is by "travelling" to the other side of particle 1. Even though the two points are the same, we can only connect them by traversing a distance of at least $2r$, therefore it is not collapsible to a point. Fortunately, our story ends there, as all other loops which start and return to the same position (in real space, not $RP^2$) _can_ be contracted: imagine the loop of your shoelace closing.


{/** TODO: Add visualization of shoelace closing 
    *

    */}
 


We of course need to be mindful of the missing $\Delta=\{\textbf{0}\}$ and the fact that we are looking at the situation $d=|\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2}|=1$ . Luckily these statements hold for any $d\in\mathbb{R}$. Even if $d$ is tiny, we will always be able to "lift" the loop over the missing point at the origin. Only $d=0$ would possibly provide some difficulties, but a point is contractible to a point, and$d=0$ is excluded from the space.


{/** TODO:  Clarify why being R3-Delta only has a single loop to worry about

    * labels: clarification 
    */}
 

Therefore there are two different kinds of paths. Now we are truly able to appreciate how indistinguishability changes the number of "paths", as $\mathbb{R}^3-\Delta$ has only one kind of loop, namely the full exchange, which would lead to only one kind of particle existing.

#### 2D cannot be contracted to a point because you cannot move over the missing points

Let us now turn to the actually interesting case of a $2D$ system and how it gives rise to different homotopy equivalent paths. We start off with our CM/distance representation, but this time in 2D, leading to our full configuration space

$$Q_2=\mathbb{R}^2\times \frac{\mathbb{R}^2 -\Delta}{S_2}$$

and will be focusing on the latter half,

$$Q_2'=\frac{\mathbb{R}^2-\Delta}{S_2}$$

where once again, $\Delta$ is the set of points where $(\mathbf{r_1},\mathbf{r_2})$ intersect, i.e., the set $\{\mathbf{0}\}$, and $\frac{}{S_2}$ indicates the equivocation of all configurations symmetric under permutation invariance, i.e., $(\mathbf{r_1, r_2})=(\mathbf{r_2,r_1}) \quad \forall \mathbf{r_1,r_2}$.

If we once again, for ease of visualization, restrict $Q_2'$ to only those configuration for which $|\mathbf{r_1-r_2}|=d$, picking $d=1$ for convenience, we obtain the space commonly referred to as the _real projective line_ $RP^1$. Unlike its planar cousin from before, $RP^1$ allows us to make some simpler arguments regarding its connectedness, as it is [[Homeomorphic|homeomorphic]] (“topologically equivalent”)
to a circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and since the circle is multiply-connected with However, just because it is homeomorphic does not mean they are "the same space”, as$RP^1$ can equivalently be described as

1) The set of all lines crossing the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$
2) A circle with each opposite point identified
3) The real line with a "point at infinity", which would be a single point “at” $-\infty$ and $\infty$.

As with $RP^2$, we consider the 1-exchange and 2-exchange paths. Clearly the 1-exchange path is non-contractible again, for the same reasons as before.
However, unlike $RP^2$ or the sphere, a 2-exchange in $RP^2$ or the circle is _also_ not contractible to a point. This is relatively obvious for a circle, as the path of the particle is constrained to the actual circle, but it is easy to see that the same would hold in our actual configuration space $Q_2'$: a missing point in $R_2$ _does_ constitute a hole, as it "pierces" the space. Therefore, any loop encircling our missing point $\Delta$ cannot be shrunk to a point, since there is no way to "lift" it over the hole, similar to how an infinitely long cylinder would act in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, we have at least three equivalence classes of homotopy-equivalent paths: no exchange, 1-exchange, _and_ 2-exchange.

That is not all, however. Since a 2-exchange differs from a point, we can simply add another exchange (4-exchange in our lingo) to create a new loop which is _also_ not homotopy equivalent to either a point nor a 2-exchange. Moreover, it matters which way we go about exchanging these particles: a clockwise loop and an anti-clockwise loop cannot be smoothly deformed into one another, as the path would have to cross the origin. Therefore, we apparently have the same number of possible paths as there are integers! [^5] A bit of a step up from the situation in $3D$: instead of just two types of particles we suddenly have a
(countable) infinity of them! As we shall see, this will lead to the anyons being able to take on "any" phase.

    *  
    * labels: expansion
    */}
 

#### P Another way of arguing for the same thing is by using the definition that phase is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the space

While categorizing configuration spaces is all very well and good, it is high time to connect this back to the physics, as we have not yet shown how the equivalence classes of homotopy equivalent paths relate to the number of particles. The way to do so is to extend our collection of equivalence classes slightly and describe what is called the _fundamental group_ of a space. The fundamental group $\pi_1$, also called the _first homotopy group_, of a space is, as the name suggests, a _group_ consisting of the set of equivalence classes of homotopy equivalent paths and path-concatenation as the group action.[^6]
Path concatenation is what it sounds like: in the fundamental group of $RP^2$ we have two homotopy classes of paths, the 1-exchange and the 2-exchange.
Concatenating these paths is simply traversing the one after the other,
resulting in a "3"-exchange, which is the same as a 1-exchange and in our group.[^7]

We already obtained the fundamental groups, which roughly look like

$$
\pi_1(Q_3')=\{X_0, X_1 \cdot\}
$$

for the $3D$ case with $X_1$ being the single exchange, $X_0$ doing nothing (and the double exchange), and $\cdot$ being path-concatenation and

$$
\pi_1(Q_2')=\{X_0, X_1, X_{-1}, X_2, X_{-2}, ... \cdot \}
$$

for the $2D$ case with $X_0$ being doing nothing, $X_i$ a clockwise $i$-exchange, and $X_{-i}$ a counterclockwise $i$-exchange.

Fantastic, so we are done, right? Well, yes, sort of, however the point of writing down these groups in addition to simply finding the homotopy classes is that hopefully we are able to do slightly more with the former. While that could be possible with these groups, it might be nicer to relate them to some more thoroughly classified groups in order to save ourselves some work. Additionally, the groups we found are those for $2$ particles, and being able to easily generalize these groups to any $N$ number of particles. Rigorously deriving the fundamental group of a space is not trivial, the standard references for the fundamental spaces in this case being @Fox1962 and @Fadell1962. ==Instead of doing this rigorously like mathematicians, we will go about this as physicists: look at the result and then convince ourselves they make sense.==

This relating is done through finding an isomorphism between these groups. It turns out that, for $N$ particles, the fundamental groups are

$$\pi_1(Q_3')=S_N$$$$\pi_1(Q_2')=B_N$$


##### Symmetry group

{/* TODO: Expand the Symmetry Group section */}


Here $S_N$ is the _symmetry group_, the set of all unique permutations of $N$ "things", together with the permutation operation $P_i$, which you could define as exchanging thing $i$ with thing $i+1$.

##### Braid group

{/** TODO: Add figures that show off the difference between braid group and symmetry group in Anyon chapter 
    * 
    * labels: visualization
    * milestones: 
    */}
 

The fundamental group of our $2D$ configuration space is isomorphic to the
_Braid group_, a group often studied in knot theory as braids can be seen as cut knots. The $N$-dimensional Braid group can be seen as all the possible
_braids_ of $N$ strands, together with the _braiding composition_ $R_i$ and its inverse $R_i^{-1}$, which stand for exchanging braid $i$ and $i+1$
clockwise and counterclockwise respectively. A braid is a set of strands
crossing over and under each other and fixed at either end. Specifically,
two braids are the same if the strands can be moved into the same
configuration without phasing through each other or moving the endpoints.
Because of this, the Braid group fundamentally differs from the symmetry
group, as for the symmetry group $\{123\}$ and $\{231\}$ are the same, they are different elements in the Braid group, see ref:fig:braidvssymmetry


{/** TODO:  Add some interesting properties
    * 
    * labels: expansion
    * milestones:  
    */}
 

1) Every braid group has infinite elements, because $R_i^n\neq R_i$.
2) Braids cannot "move" back

The Braid group can help us in two ways: it can show us which phase anyons pick up and provide us with some physical intuition.

The phase of a system under exchange `is defined as` the 1D representation of the fundamental group

#### Intuiting

We can use some intuition about the braid group and braids to construct a somewhat reasonable 3D space which is also multiply connected.

The braid group also allows us to use some physical intuition to this otherwise rather abstract discussion. This allows us to construct a different _three_-dimensional configuration space which can still give rise to anyons.

By taking the $y$-axis to represent time and the $x$-axis the 2D plane the particles move in, we can imagine the _braids_ of the braid group to be the _worldlines_ of our anyons. While this representation is not entirely accurate (the braid-group is technically only the group of the homotopic paths of the distances with two particles), if we take it to correspond approximately we see why these braids `do not work` in $3+1D$ : =braids can untangle themselves in 4 dimensions. However, this is only the case for 1D braids, if instead they are thicker, then they can get entangled.

# Footnotes
[^1]: Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.
[^2]: Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.
[^3]: The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.
[^4]: This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the "one particle standing still" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the "moving" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\pi$ radians.
[^5]: It turns out that the 1-exchange do not turn out to be a separate path, or at least it does not change the number of possible paths, since $2*\aleph_0=\aleph_0$. There are a number of different ways to show this more exactly, but the easiest is to note that $RP^1$ is homeomorphic to the circle, and the 1-exchange is not a separate path there.
[^6]: Technically the fundamental group is only defined at a specific point $x_0$. However, if the space is _path-connected_, roughly meaning that it is possible to draw a path between any to points in the space, the fundamental groups at all points are isomorphic. All the spaces under consideration are path-connected, so I leave out this detail. An example of a non-path-connected space is the real line minus the origin, $\mathbb{R} - 0$. It is impossible to draw a path between any point $<0$ to one $>0$.

[^7]: As an exercise, check whether this group satisfies the axioms of a [[Group]]
