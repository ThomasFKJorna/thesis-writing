The main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles:
anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed _any_ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[^1] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be _approximately_ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but _exactly_ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].

Another reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires _topological_ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. `The opposite of topology is geometry`

## What are we going to do

The following chapter will consist of four sections. In section 2, we will first attempt to understand what anyons are and why they are commonly thought of as a uniquely 2D phenomenon. The most important feature turns out to be how to define_path-uniqueness_, which is commonly defined either topologically or geometrically, the latter being the focus of section 3. To understand the topological notion of path-uniqueness (homotopy) we will examine how this works in 3D and then in 2D. Using a toy model we show that anyons are not a uniquely 2D phenomenon by constructing a non-simply connected 3D space using somewhat plausible assumptions.

After working through the problem topologically and gaining a thorough understanding of the conceptual difficulties that come with it, we turn our gaze to how path uniqueness is construed using the geometry of the space. One of the downside of the topological account is that it provides no way of calculating the specific phase of a particle, only stating that in 2D such phase could arise, so a geometric account would be welcome. It turns out that said geometry account (the so-called Berry-Phase) relies, unsurprisingly, heavily on the physical features of the system, making it difficult to reason about the possibily of a geometric explanation of anyons in the abstract. We therefore turn to a physical system which purportedly produces anyons: the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE).

In section 4 we work through the FQHE, showing why anyons are involved and,
importantly, what idealization play a role in constructing the wave-function.
Before doing so, we recap how particles contained in magnetic fields `get`
quantized energylevels (Landau levels) and the basics of the simpler variant of the FQHE, the Integer Quantum Hall effect. These can be skipped by the impatient reader, as while some specifics of the IQHE carry over to the FQHE, mostly the conceptual basis is required, which is recapped at the end of section 3.XXX

Finally, we put all the pieces together in section 5, and see that while a geometric explanation _could_ be possible, it is not, at the moment, feasible. Later, in chapter `XXX`, I will argue if and why such a potential explanation should still be preferred to the topological account, but such conclusion cannot be drawn until we have gained a more thorough understanding of what a good explanation is in the first place.
