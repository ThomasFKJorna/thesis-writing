# Examples of (infinite) idealizations
While accurate, Norton's examples are a bit dry and do not capture the problems and allure of infinite idealizations in a compelling way.

The difficulty with coming up with good examples of infinite idealizations is that they're so dependent on the specific physics.
Maybe I can leverage Norton's examples, but just make them a bit more tangible, maybe engineering.

## Norton's Examples

### Pills baby!
A cylinder is a bad approximation for a pill, but it gets better and better as the pill is longer and longer.
However, in the infinite case it's bad again.
