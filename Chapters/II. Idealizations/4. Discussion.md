# 4. Discussion

While these distinctions might appear nitpicky, I think they are vital for making sure we are discussing the correct problem. Additionally, in making these distinctions it became clear that perhaps more distinctions need to be made, such as the specific nature of the contradiction induced, see Section X.

What is clear is how infinite idealizations (the interesting ones at least) differ from idealizations in general or simple ones. Infinite idealizations are a subcategory of idealizations, together with simple idealizations (whether they completely fill the category of idealization is left open). However, the distinction between infinite idealizations and simple idealizations does not prove particularly enlightening. Other distinctions will be more fruitful to investigate. I do not think this warrants a change in nomenclature per se, as there is substantial literature on infinite idealizations already. Clarification would be in order though.
