### [[The configuration space approach explains the possibility of anyons, not their occurence]]

#### The configuration space approach to quantum statistics does not (aim) to explain _when_ anyons _will_ occur, just that they can/have to occur in two dimensions.

I was very confused about the role of the use of the [[configuration space framework for identical particles]] for describing anyons/the quantum hall effect, as it felt superfluous when the _appearance_ of [[fractional quantum statistics]] in  [[the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]] is justified/calculated using the [[Berry Connection]], which has no real clear tie to the configuration space framework.

### [[Fractional statistics can only be calculated using adiabaticity]]

#### Fractional statistics can only be calculated using the assumption of adiabaticity

[[Fractional Quantum Statistics]] that appear in the quantum hall effect are calculated with the [[Berry Connection]]  using the assumption of [[adiabatic theorem (quantum)]], which says that a things won't move out of the ground state if you move it very slowly.

### [[Quasi-things Have Charge e or m|Quasi-things Have Charge e/m]]

#### Quasi-holes/particles carry charge e/m â€º Berry Connection

The above "proof" is rather shoddy. However, we can make a more educated guess by looking using the [[Berry Connection]]
