# Proper time

**Proper time** $\Delta\tau=\Delta t-\Delta x-\Delta y -\Delta z$[^1] is the invariant quantity in [[Special Relativity]] and the way distance is measured in [[Minkowski Spacetime]].

Using the [[Einstein summation notation]], we can cleverly write this as

where $\eta$ is the [[Minkowski Metric]] and $x_\mu$ and $x_\nu$ are [[Four-vector|Four-vectors.]]

[^1]: Let's just set $c=1$ shall we, otherwise this is annoying.
