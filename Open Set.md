# Open set

## Functional analysis definition

Given a [[Metric Space]] $(X,d)$, a set $A\subseteq X$ is called an **open set** if

if for each point in $A$ there exists an [[Open ball]] which is a subset of $A$.

Another way of phrasing this is that $A$ is open if it doesn't have a [[Boundary]], or more specifically if its boundary does not lie within itself, such that$$
A \cap \partial A = \emptyset
$$
