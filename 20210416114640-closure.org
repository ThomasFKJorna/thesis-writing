* Closure (set)

The *closure* $\bar{A}$ of a subset $A$ of a [[file:20210416111039-metric_space.org][Metric Space]] $(X,d)$ is the smallest [[file:20210416113831-closed_set.org][Closed set]] containing $A$, which is the union of $A$ and its [[file:20210416114103-boundary.org][Boundary]].
\begin{equation}
\bar{A}:=A\cup\partial A
    \label{eq:closure}
\end{equation}

Example: The closure of $(0,1)\in \mathbb{R}  $ is $[0,1]$
