* The Laughlin Wavefunction is guessed from general grounds

[[id:fff6c214-ce92-4f4f-be7f-71eb21efff79][The Laughlin Wavefunction]] is just guessed for the FQHE $\approx10^{11}$ and was pretty close.

However, the guess, is not "just a guess", it is based on the following considerations:

- [[id:12bf23b8-7c2f-439b-84f1-92807e5f93b3][Every QH WF must have the form f_z(z1...zn)exp(-sum|zi|2)]]
- [[id:9edb93f2-bb71-42ed-8a72-89abaa8a5cc3][Every QH WF must be antisymmetric]]
- It has to fit a specific toy model


What's more, the LWF is not even that good of an approximation, instead it is the WF of a fake Hamiltonian.
