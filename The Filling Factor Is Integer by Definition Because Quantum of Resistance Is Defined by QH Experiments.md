# The Filling Factor Is Integer by Definition Because Quantum of Resistance is Defined by QH experiments

The filling factor which factors into the deliniation of the different plateaux and valleys in the Quantum hall effects is not just suspisiously close to an integer: it is an integer. The resistivity of the plateaus is determined as$\rho_{xy}=\frac{2\pi\hbar}{e^2}\frac{1}{\nu}$

but the $2\pi\\hbar/e^2$ is in fact set by quantum hall experiments. This is problematic because...
