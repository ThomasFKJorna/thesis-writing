#+title: Parallel transport
#+filetags: definition mathematics


When you *parallel transport* a vector through some curved space, it will, in general, not end up at the exact same angle (wrt to the origin) as it had at the start.

You can think of parallel transport as taking a vector /tangent/ to the surface of some manifold on a journey from and then back to its starting point.

It is, in general, /path dependent/: it matters /how/ you get to the endpoint, not just /where/.
