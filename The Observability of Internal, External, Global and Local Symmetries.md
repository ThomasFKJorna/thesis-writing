# The observability of internal, external, global and local symmetries

| Observation    | Scope                      | ? | [[External Symmetry|External]]                                     | ? | [[internal symmetry|internal]]                   |

| Transformation | [[Global symmetry|Global]] | ☑ | Looking out the window while driving at constant speed             | ☑ | I ($\alpha - 2p^+$ ) = I($\alpha-n-p^+$)         |

From this we can conclude a few things.

[[Local internal symmetries are not directly observable]][[Physical theories must be globally symmetric and can be locally symmetric]]

This is completely based on [@Kosso2000] 's account of symmetries in physics. This is a hotly debated topic in the literature and should not be taken as gospel.
