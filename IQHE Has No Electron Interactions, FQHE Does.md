# IQHE Has No Electron Interactions, FQHE Does

In [[the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]], the electron interactions are turned off, only taking into account the fact that [[fermions cannot be in the same quantum state (Pauli Exclusion Principle)]] but otherwise neglecting repulsion.

This is different for [[the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]].

This leads to the interesting question of [[is the neglection of electron interactions in IQHE justified?]]
