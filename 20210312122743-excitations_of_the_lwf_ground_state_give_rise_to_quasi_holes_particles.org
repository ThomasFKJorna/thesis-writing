* Excitations of the LWF Ground State Give Rise to Quasi-holes/particles

When a system with [[id:fff6c214-ce92-4f4f-be7f-71eb21efff79][The Laughlin Wavefunction]] as a ground state (a Toy model) is excited by either "injecting" a hole or electron, this hole or particle "gets split up" into $m$ quasi-holes, $m$ being the filling fraction thingy.
