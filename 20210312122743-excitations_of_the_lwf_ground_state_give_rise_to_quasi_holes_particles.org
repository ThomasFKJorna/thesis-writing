* Excitations of the LWF Ground State Give Rise to Quasi-holes/particles

When a system with [[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]] as a ground state (a Toy model) is excited by either "injecting" a hole or electron, this hole or particle "gets split up" into $m$ quasi-holes, $m$ being the filling fraction thingy.
