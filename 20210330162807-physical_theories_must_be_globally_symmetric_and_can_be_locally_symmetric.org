#+title: Physical theories must be globally symmetric and can be locally symmetric
#+filetags: physics symmetry

* Physical theories /must/ be [[id:475c6db1-e5a0-4ebb-8291-5454a9e6d12e][Globally]] symmetric, and /can/ be [[id:deba623a-e0d9-4db3-96e3-3cf22681ef43][Locally]] symmetric

This is because we cannot directly observe local symmetries and have to add a dynamical priciple which takes them into account.
