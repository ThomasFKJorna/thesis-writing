# SO(2)

The special orthogonal group **SO(2)** is the [[Group]] of all [[Orthogonal]]  $2x2$  matrices with [[Determinant]] $1$ under matrix multiplications.

The group composes all matrices which are orthogonal, i.e. $O^T O =1$, and $\det(O)=+!$

A common [[Representation]] of this group are matrices of the form

$SO(2)$ is relevant for physics, because it describes rotations in the $2D$ plane.

It is a subgroup of the general orthogonal group [[O(2)]], which does not have the $\det=1$ restriction, and describes rotations and _reflections_ in the $2D$ plane.

$SO(2)$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the scalar unitary group [[U(1)]]
