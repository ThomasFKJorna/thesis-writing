* Fractional statistics can only be calculated using the assumption of adiabaticity

[[id:313f0a05-b6e3-43f8-8f2f-f004790dc798][Fractional Quantum Statistics]] that appear in the quantum hall effect are calculated with the [[id:3dad96b9-a6bf-449f-981e-4e141f865dd5][Berry Connection]]  using the assumption of [[id:75068634-a939-42ae-815f-8c31d02cf5f5][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]], which says that a things won't move out of the ground state if you move it very slowly.

This might be a problem as [[id:934df62f-db20-4c3f-917e-862161f797fc][Norton2014: Infinite Idealizations]] because [[id:cb0659a9-ab48-42c9-a518-f059a12aeb0e][Adiabaticity is an infinite idealization]]. Since I am examining infinite idealiziatons and Shech is arguing for an infinite idealization using this assumption, he might be once again spinning in circles.

However, [[id:50b9ed61-c160-435d-aa77-6ffb6cc7cd27][The Adiabatic Theorem might not be an Inf Id because it only guarantees something that might happen anyway]]
