# The Explanation of FQHE is an After the Fact Justification Rather Than a Straightforward Derivation

Contrary to what Shech's account of the FQHE ([[Notes on Shechs Description of FQHE]]) might suggest, the common explanation of said effect is not at all like a prediction or theoretic framework built upon one solid idealization, namely that of the 2D nature of the system. Rather it is a combination of approximations, handwave-y analogies and downright questionable assumptions which allow us to _intuit_, not derive, what could perhaps happen at the plateaux of the FQHE.

This is in contrast to the explanations offered for the IQHE.

One example of this is that not only [[The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds|the wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED]], but that the [[the Laughlin WF only applies to v=1 or m|the Laughlin WF only applies to v=1/m]]
