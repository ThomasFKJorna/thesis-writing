# Impurities Turn Many Quantum States From Extended to Localized

![](./media/breakdegen.png)

Impurities in the sample are modeled as a random potential. This random potential first ensures that [[Impurities Break the Degeneracy of the Landau Levels]] by broadening them, but secondly they "cut up" the quantum states of the system into extended and localized states. Extended states "extend" throughout the whole system, while localized states do not.
