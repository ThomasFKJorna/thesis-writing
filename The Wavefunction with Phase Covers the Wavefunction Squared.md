The space of the wavefunction multiplied with some  [[Geometric Phase|phase]]  $e^{i\theta}\ket{\psi}$, say $X$, [[Cover|cover]]s the space of the probabilty density of the wavefunction, the wavefunction modulo-squared $|\psi|^2$, say $Y$.

There are an uncountably infinite number of points in $X$ which map unto a single point in $Y$. This is why the phase is not considered to be physical, because it does not matter.

However, this statement is perhaps slightly misleading, because it often wavefunctions with different phases are combined, leading to [[Interference|interference]].
