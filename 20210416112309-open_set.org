* Open set

** Functional analysis definition
Given a [[id:e997346e-b3dd-48da-8597-93acac415fa1][Metric Space]] $(X,d)$, a set $A\subseteq X$ is called an *open set* if
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in A, \exists B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A
    \label{eq:openset}
\end{equation}
if for each point in $A$ there exists an [[id:913ee774-c9c9-4476-a619-b62d0f351378][Open ball]] which is a subset of $A$.

Another way of phrasing this is that $A$ is open if it doesn't have a [[id:d4e7ecd5-3f71-4e10-b967-b9ad290c27e5][Boundary]], or more specifically if its boundary does not lie within itself, such that
$$A \cap \partial A = \emptyset$$
