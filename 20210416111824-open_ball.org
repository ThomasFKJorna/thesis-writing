* Open ball

Given a [[file:20210416111039-metric_space.org][Metric Space]] $r(X,d)$, an *open ball* $B_\epsilon(x)$ is the set of all points for which are "within" a certain distance of $x$, such that
\begin{equation}
B_\epsilon(x):=\{y\in X | d(x,y)<\epsilon\}
    \label{eq:openball}
\end{equation}
