* 3D Quantum Hall Effect

In addition to the general [[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][quantum hall effect,]] which is, alledgedly, a completely 2D phenomenon, physicsts also appear to be interested in the *3 dimensional quantum hall effect*.

Originally proposed by cite:Halperin1987, lately some experimental success has been had with it cite:Tang2019.

This is important for my thesis as I have up until now been assuming that the QHE is actually a 3D thing, treated as 2D out of laziness/ease, but having people talk separately about the 3D effect makes me question this a little. I still think I'm right, but it would be wise to include this somewhere in the [[file:chapter-anyons.org][FQHE/anyon chapter]].

Furthermore, it seems that for physicists the [[file:20210601145636-dimensionality_of_an_electron_gas_is_determined_by_fermi_surface_topology.org][Dimensionality of an electron gas is determined by Fermi Surface topology]]

I think this will make good 'catches' section at the end of the chapter, but I don't need to concern myself with it just yet.
