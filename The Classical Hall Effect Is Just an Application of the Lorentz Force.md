# The classical Hall Effect is just an application of the Lorentz Force

The Hall voltage $V_h$ happens when a magnetic field perpendicular to a thin, current carrying conductor induces a Lorentz force and thus a potential difference across said conductor.

This is the <u>Hall Effect</u>. It is a classical effect and the voltage thus increases linearly according to Ohms law R=V/I

## Specifically, the characterization of the CHE is that the transversal current varies linearly with the strength of the magnetic field and that the longitudinal resistance is small but nonvanishing

I'm not sure why the longitudinal resistance is super important, but i guess it is just "normal" resistance
