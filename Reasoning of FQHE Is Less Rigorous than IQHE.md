# reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE

Basically, with interaction taken into account, it won't be possible to use [[perturbation theory]] and thus to calculate the wavefunctions somewhat precisely.

Instead, [[The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds|the wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED]]

Unfortunately, this leads to [[The Explanation of FQHE is an After the Fact Justification Rather Than a Straightforward Derivation]]
