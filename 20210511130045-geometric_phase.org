* Geometric phase

If a quantum system is adiabatically transported from and back to its original /parameters,/ while keeping the system in the same state, it picks up a [[file:20210511110338-phase_quantum.org][Phase (quantum)]] called the *geometric phase*.

Here are some examples:

Examples are the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]], which is a general phase that a particle picks up whenever it cyclically traverses parameter space; [[file:20210311113613-the_aharonov_bohm_effect_ab.org][the Aharonov Bohm effect (AB)]], which is a rather specific phase that gets picked up by a particle when it cycles around a flux (which was thought not to affect systems physically). and, the most interesting to me, the cyclic traversal (exchange) of identical particles in real space, giving rise to [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].

Interestingly, the above table indicated that this is a topological phenomenon, which is precisely what I aim to show is /not/ the case.

The main goal of my case study is to relate, quite clearly, the Berry phase to the geometric phase. This is not easy, see this stackoverflow discussion. https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology

* References

A good paper to look at would be cite:Berry1997 for the connection of Berry phase to [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]]
Nevermind, it's not at all about that, it's about deriving fermions and bosons, does not even mention anyons.
