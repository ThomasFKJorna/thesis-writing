* Connection

A *connection* is an operation that allows for [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]] over [[file:20210511130921-vector_bundle.org][Vector Bundles]].

Physicists often refer to this as a "vector potential" instead, as "all vector potentials defined over a vector bundle must differ by a /connection/ much like how all vector potentials attributed to an electromagnetic field are related to one another by a [[file:20210330155645-gauge_symmetry.org][gauge transformation]]" cite:Cohen2019 (pp.440)
