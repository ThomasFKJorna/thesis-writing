* Connection

A *connection* is an operation that allows for [[id:71b7fa31-7712-4a3a-a3ff-825298ed86cd][Parallel transport]] over [[id:50207fe2-18a6-451f-84b8-3d3e934535fa][Vector Bundles]].

Physicists often refer to this as a "vector potential" instead, as "all vector potentials defined over a vector bundle must differ by a /connection/ much like how all vector potentials attributed to an electromagnetic field are related to one another by a [[id:c18acba0-88cd-48c2-bfa7-755bb15bee31][gauge transformation]]" cite:Cohen2019 (pp.440)
