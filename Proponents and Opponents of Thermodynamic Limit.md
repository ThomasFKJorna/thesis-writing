# Proponents and opponents of thermodynamic limit

\*Proponents and oppontents of thermodynamic limits

[@Butterfield2011\,Callender2001\,Menon2011]  and  Palacios 2018 argue that the thermodynamic limit is fake, while Bangu 2009, [@Batterman2005] Batterman2011 and Morrisson 2012 say that it is essential.

See also [@Shech2018a] for good lists.
