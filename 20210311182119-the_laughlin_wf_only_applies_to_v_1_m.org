* The Laughlin Wavefunction only applies to FQH states with $\nu=1/m$

[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]] is only applicable to states with a filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{m}\quad m\in\mathbb{N}$.
Even such a super guessy messy WF cannot be used to describe states that have different filling factors, those we can only derive.
