# Thesis Ideas

It's important for me to trick myself into doing my thesis, and what's a better way than to do some development?

# Make thesis interactive

text is boring, I can make my thesis way more interesting by making figures/whatever interactive.

## Sliders to emphasize vagueness/boundaries

Bald man ---------------------- Hairy man

Drag slider and see man lose hair in real time. When is he bald? Vote now on your phones.

# Create some kind of interface for git so that guido and ronnie can see a continuous stream of my updates.

Public acountability helps me a lot with doing things, maybe too much.
Idea here is: create some kind of webpage where you can easily see diffs between commits for my thesis.

Ideally:

- Just for Ronnie and Guido
- Show some sort of timeline
- They could comment on things
