# Idealization vs Approximation

# Context

This is one of the main distinctions that I use in my thesis: approximation and idealization get used in much the same way, but not exactly: what distinguishes them? Norton claims to have an answer.

# Thought

The difference (for Norton) between an approximation and an idealization is:

- Approximation

  - Proposition, e.g. F<sub>airresistance</sub> = 0
  - Statement about a property of a target system, just a wrong one (which is close enough for the purposes described)
- Idealization

  - A whole ass target system, e.g. a ball falling in a world without air
  - Properties of this system, e.g. F<sub>air</sub> = 0, can be taken as descriptions of the actual system

These are easy to get confused, see[[Confusing Approximations and Idealizations]]
