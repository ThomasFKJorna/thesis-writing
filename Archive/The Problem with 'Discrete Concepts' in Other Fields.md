# The Problem with 'Discrete Concepts' in Other Fields

However, I'm not the first person to think about this, but other do not put things into these words. I want to create a kind of overview for terms related to this, AND how they differ from what I see as the problem This is a sort of precursor for [[Relevant papers for discrete continuous transition|Relevant papers for discrete continuous transitio]]


## Vagueness

Not really a part of a super rigorous(ly defined) discipline, somewhere in the intersection of philosophy of language and larger analytical philosophy. The most concrete version I've seen is probably [@Greenough2003], but it still isn't really situated in any discussion about reference or something.

## Natural Kinds

This is discussed both in philosophy of language (is water H20?) and in philosophy of biology, usually (as most phil of bio) in the context of evolutionary biology about what a species "is".
Philosophers of language also talk about this, but simultanuously more and less rigorously, in that they do talk about referents etc but usually do not talk about the biological journey of a species, which in my mind makes it kind of useless (fucking Kripke)

## Essentialism

Ye olde debate in metaphysics/philosophy of language, but also in phil of bio. While some try to wiggle themselves out of this, I
