[[Fractional Quantum Statistics]] that appear in the quantum hall effect are calculated with the [[Berry Connection]]  using the assumption of [[adiabatic theorem (quantum)]], which says that a things won't move out of the ground state if you move it very slowly.

This might be a problem as [[Norton2014: Infinite Idealizations]] because [[Adiabaticity is an infinite idealization]]. Since I am examining infinite idealiziatons and Shech is arguing for an infinite idealization using this assumption, he might be once again spinning in circles.

However, [[The Adiabatic Theorem might not be an Inf Id because it only guarantees something that might happen anyway]]
