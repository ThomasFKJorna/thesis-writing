The word **space** in mathematics always confused me, but I think that you can think of a space as just a [[Set]] with some structure.

Examples are [[Topological space]]s, which are just sets with a topology structure defined on them, [[Metric Space]]s, which are just sets with a [[Vector space]] and metric defined on it, etc etc.

This reassures me.
