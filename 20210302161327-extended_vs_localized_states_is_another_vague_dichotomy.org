#+title: extended vs localized states is another vague dichotomy

* Context
In order to explain the integer quantum hall effect, it is claimed that [[id:d5074aea-3aab-4aa7-954c-7307e3907a17][impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized]]. However, this requires another dichotomy to strongly hold, namely that of localized vs extended states, both of which have mutually exclusive properties: extended states conduct, while localized states do not.

This is fishy
