#+title: extended vs localized states is another vague dichotomy
#+filetags: stump "false dichotomy" FQHE

* Context
In order to explain the integer quantum hall effect, it is claimed that [[file:20210302160720-impurities_turn_many_quantum_states_from_extended_to_localized.org][impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized]]. However, this requires another dichotomy to strongly hold, namely that of localized vs extended states, both of which have mutually exclusive properties: extended states conduct, while localized states do not.

This is fishy
