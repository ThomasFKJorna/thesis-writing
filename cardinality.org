* Cardinality

The *cardinality* of a [[id:25a5762d-db61-4f84-9962-b96e20c7e84b][Set]] describes the size of said set.


* Examples

** Discrete
The caridinality of the set  $\{1,2,3\}$ is $3$, as it has 3 elements.

** Countable

The cardinality of the set of all natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is $\aleph_0$.
All sets which can be brought in one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$ are said to be [[id:b476726a-277a-49aa-88e3-afe48b85fc14][Countably infinite]].

** Uncountable

The cardinality of the set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is $\aleph_1$.
