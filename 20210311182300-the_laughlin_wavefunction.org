* The Laughlin Wavefunction

The Laughlin Wavefunction was guesseda by Laughlin in 1982 to approximately describe the Fractional Quantum Hall States at the filling fractions $\nu=1/m$ with $m\in\mathbb{N}$.

It is written as
\begin{equation}
    \psi(z_i)=\prod_{i<q}(z_i-z_j)^m e^{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{z_i}/4l_B^2}
    \label{eq:LWF}
\end{equation}
