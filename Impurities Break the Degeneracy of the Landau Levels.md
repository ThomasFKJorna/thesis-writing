# Impurities break the degeneracy of the Landau Levels

The Landau levels in the IQHE "ideally" look like this
```

```

However, this is an extremely idealized sketch which never occurs or could possibly occur. In reality, samples are "dirty" (interesting that more common materials are seen as dirty, some kind of deviation from the norm), which (somehow) breaks the symmetry/degeneracy of the Landau levels, which makes them look more like this
