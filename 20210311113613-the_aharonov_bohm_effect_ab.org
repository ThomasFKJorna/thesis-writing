* The Aharonov Bohm effect

The Aharonov Bohm effect is the phenomenon in which particles ONLY sense a [[id:6734d031-a55d-4428-99f9-16cd9525a8f7][gauge potential]] field and because of this pick up a [[id:5441a486-c826-424d-a30a-e08b9208642b][Berry phase]], which then leads to interference.

The classical example has two particles go through the double slit experiment, but behind the slits there's an infinite solenoid through which a magnetic field is pushed, leading to a potential field $\textbf{A}$ and a flux $\phi$ which are experienced by the particles, unlike the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, which leads to them picking up a phase and changing the interference pattern in a measurable way.

The main conclusion of this is that the potential field has physical effects.
