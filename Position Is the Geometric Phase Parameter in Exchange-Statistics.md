# Position is the geometric phase parameter in exchange-statistics

# The relevant parameter for the geometric phase is position in exchange statistics

The [[Geometric Phase]] arises when you vary the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the system slowly from and back to their original starting point, tracing out a path in parameter space.

The relevant parameter could be anything, [@Tong2016] uses magnetic strenght as a parameter at some point.
For my thesis, however, I am interested in [[Quantum Statistics]] which arise when two particles are _physically_ exchanged. So the relevant parameter I am looking at when studying  [[Anyons]] is just position, which is easy to think about (in some sense).
