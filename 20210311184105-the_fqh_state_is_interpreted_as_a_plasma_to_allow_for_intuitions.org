* The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions

In order to get a grip on the FQHE, people resort to looking at [[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]  as a plasma, because while the Laughlin WF is easy to write down, it is hard to calculate with.

This is done like....

From the plasma analogy, we can intuit that
