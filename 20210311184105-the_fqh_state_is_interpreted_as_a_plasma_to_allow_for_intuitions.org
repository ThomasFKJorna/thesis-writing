* The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions

In order to get a grip on the FQHE, people resort to looking at [[id:fff6c214-ce92-4f4f-be7f-71eb21efff79][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]  as a plasma, because while the Laughlin WF is easy to write down, it is hard to calculate with.

This is done like....

From the plasma analogy, we can intuit that
