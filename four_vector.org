* Four-vector
A *four-vector* is vector-form often used in [[file:special_relativity.org][relativistic]] physics, defined as
\begin{equation}
x_\mu=\begin{pmatrix}x_0\\x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq:fourvector}
\end{equation}

where $x_0$ is often time or a time-relevant quantity such as energy.

The lenght of a four vector is
\begin{equation}
x^2=x\cdot x\equiv x_\mu x_\nu  \eta^{\mu\nu}
    \label{eq:lenghtfourvector}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the [[file:minkowski_metric.org][Minkowski Metric]].

The most common four vector is the proper time $\tau$, whose length is the invariant quantity in special relativity.
