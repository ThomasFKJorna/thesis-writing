#+title: the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)
#+filetags: :definition:FQHE:

The Integer Quantum Hall effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux and valleys in respectively the transversal and longitudinal resistances associated with the Hall effect.

These plateaux ccur at the integer multiples of the quantum of resistance

\[
\rho_{xy} = 2\pi\hbar/e^2\nu = \frac{1}{\nu} R_H
\]



In fact, these plateaux are so flat, and their associated $\nu$, called the [[id:b9c034ae-c43c-488b-8c96-996789ac2695][filling factor]], is measured so accurately, that the IQHE is used to /determine/ the quantum of resitance, therefore the $\nu$ s are by definition integers (or at least the first one). (Interesting enough to warrant its own note, see [[id:b502892a-411c-4fa7-a88c-7141b640d0e7][The Filling Factor Is Integer by Definition Because Quantum of Resistance is Defined by QH experiments]] )


One interesting feature of the IQHE is that [[id:948182b9-1c2d-4f52-b76b-51ee1c11a9cc][disordered systems exhibit IQHE MORE strongly]], thus it seems plausible that the mechanism behind the IQHE will somehow require a certain degree of disorder in its description.
