      "abstractNote": "<section class=\"abstract\"><h2 class=\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\" id=\"d50e2\">Abstract</h2><p>In a series of papers, Elizabeth Barnes and Robert Williams have developed a theory of metaphysical vagueness in which they argue for <em>legitimacy</em> of vague object and indeterminate identity. In his recent paper, Ken Akiba raises two objections against Barnes-Williams theory, concluding that it is <em>ill-conceived and wrong-headed</em>. In one objection, he argues that the theory implies indeterminate identity between referentially determinate objects to which <em>λ</em>-abstraction is applicable, and hence Evans’ argument ultimately goes through. In the other, he objects that Barnes-Williams theory also fails to block Salmon’s argument. This paper discusses the two objections. It argues that there are legitimate reasons for rejecting both, and hence to revive Barnes-Williams theory. Furthermore, it is shown that the objections, while unsuccessful, are helpful in revealing the limitations of Barnes-Williams theory.</p></section>",

      "abstractNote": "An elementary introduction is given to the concept of anyons—quantum particles whose ‘statistics’ interpolate smoothly between those of bosons and fermions. Such particles—or quasi-particle excitations—can occur in two-dimensional systems in which the particles experience strong short-range mutual repulsions. These circumstances effectively mean that one has to apply quantum mechanics to a configuration space in which some points are excluded (i.e. it has ‘holes’)—namely, those points where two particles would coincide. The Aharonov—Bohm effect provides the simplest physical example of quantum mechanics in such a non-simply connected space, and is also fundamental to a simple model for anyons. A qualitative introduction is given to two currently proposed physical applications of anyons: high temperature superconductivity, and the (fractional) quantum Hall effect.",

      "abstractNote": "The question whether quantum discontinuity can or cannot provide an answer to Zeno’s Paradoxes is reopened. It is observed that what is usually understood by the term “discontinuity”, namely, Einstein’s conception of the photon as described by himself and all others, is unsuitable to the task because, essentially, it reduces to the trivial ‘discontinuity’ of objects scattered in space. By contrast, quantization of energy levels, which are not in space but can only alternate in time, provide the right sort of discontinuity required. Discrete quantized orbits, corresponding to eigen-frequencies, are irreducible, and nothing is allowed to stand in-between them in satisfaction of the quantum postulate, furnishing the requisite, and so far missing, immediate nextness of a point to a certain other. In this way, Zeno’s Runner need not postpone his first step indefinitely, always waiting upon an infinity of preceding steps, before it can be taken. There is now a point that is next to a point and so a step on that point, which is the first step. It follows that, if one kind of discontinuity, Einstein’s, is incapable of offerring an answer to Zeno, while another kind can, the two are discrepant. One of them, the former, is not a kind of discontinuity properly so called at all, though evidently the consequence of one.",

It is embedded in a discrete formulation of classical mechanics. Second, I show that the discrete solution cannot be falsified experimentally.",

In this paper, we investigate why, to perform this task, scientists sometimes choose to use numerical methods instead of analytical solutions. Via several examples, we argue that the choice for numerical methods can be explained by the fact that, while making quantitative predictions seems at first glance to be facilitated by analytical solutions, this is actually often much easier with numerical methods. Thus we challenge the widely presumed superiority of analytical solutions over numerical methods.",

Nevertheless, Menon and Callender (2013) have outlined theoretical approaches that describe phase transitions without using the infinite limit. This paper closely investigates one of these approaches, which consists of studying the complex zeros of the partition function (Borrmann et al., 2000). Based on this theory, I argue for the plausibility for eliminating the infinite limit for studying phase transitions. I offer a new account for phase transitions in finite systems, and I argue for the use of the infinite limit as an approximation for studying phase transitions in large systems.",

I defend Leibniz from the charge of inconsistency by examining the historical development of his views on continuity in their physical and mathematical context, and also by pointing up the striking similarities of his construal of continuity to the approach taken by 20th century Combinatorial Topology.",

      "abstractNote": "There are two notions in the philosophy of probability that are often used interchangeably: that of subjective probabilities and that of epistemic probabilities. This paper suggests they should be kept apart. Specifically, it suggests that the distinction between subjective and objective probabilities refers to what probabilities are, while the distinction between epistemic and ontic probabilities refers to what probabilities are about. After arguing that there are bona fide examples of subjective ontic probabilities and of epistemic objective probabilities, I propose a systematic way of drawing these distinctions in order to take this into account. In doing so, I modify Lewis's notion of chances, and extend his Principal Principle in what I argue is a very natural way (which in fact makes chances fundamentally conditional). I conclude with some remarks on time symmetry, on the quantum state, and with some more general remarks about how this proposal fits into an overall Humean (but not quite neo-Humean) framework.

      "abstractNote": "For some authors, an adequate notion of emergence must include an account of a mechanism by means of which emergent behavior is realized. This appeal to mechanism is problematic in the case of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). There is a consensus among physicists that the FQHE exhibits emergent phenomena, but there are at least four alternative explanations of the latter that, arguably, appeal to ontologically distinct mechanisms, both at the microphysics level and at the level of general organizing principles. In light of this underdetermination of mechanism, one is faced with the following options: (I) deny that emergence is present in the FQHE; (II) argue for the priority of one mechanistic explanation over the others; or (III) temper the desire for a mechanism-centric account of emergence. I will argue that there are good reasons to reject (I) and (II) and accept (III). In particular, I will suggest that a law-centric account of emergence does just fine in explaining the emergent phenomena associated with the FQHE.",

In this paper, I argue that mathematics can sometimes help to reduce our concrete ontological, ideological, and structural commitments. My focus is on optimization explanations, and in particular the case study involving periodical cicadas. I argue that in this case, stronger mathematical apparatus yields explanations that have fewer concrete commitments. The nominalist cannot accept these more parsimonious explanations without embracing the stronger mathematics, and this poses a challenge for the nominalist position.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper I develop a framework for understanding ontic vagueness. The project of the paper is two-fold. I first outline a definitional account of ontic vagueness – one that I think is an improvement on previous attempts because it remains neutral on other, independent metaphysical issues. I then develop one potential manifestation of that basic definitional structure. This is a more robust (and much less neutral) account which gives a fully classical explication of ontic vagueness via modal concepts. The overarching aim is to systematically investigate the puzzling question of what exactly it could be for the world itself to be vague.",

This instance of extra-logical explanation is subsequently shown to be of a piece with cases of extra-mathematical explanation.

          "note": "<b>Extracted Annotations (2/28/2020, 3:58:47 PM)</b> \n\n\"Recently, nominalists such as Yablo (2012) and Saatsi (2011) have argued that it is not enough for mathematics to be explanatorily involved in science, it must be involved in the right way. This becomes clear when one considers idealizations. Idealizations, in a similar way to mathematics, boost the explanatory credentials of our best scientific theories. And yet, idealizations should not attract a realist attitude. Mathematical realists, then, need a way to differentiate the explanatory role played by idealizations from that played by mathematics in order to render an explanatory version of the indispensability argument viable. This requires saying more about the kind of explanatory role that mathematics plays in science.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=2\">Baron 2016:366</a>) \n\n\"I argue that the explanatory symmetry between idealizations and mathematics can, potentially, be broken as follows. Although idealizations contribute to the explanatory power of our best theories, they do not help to carry the explanatory load. It is, however, at least open that some (though by no means all) mathematics is load-carrying.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=2\">Baron 2016:366</a>) \n\n\"I offer a preliminary analysis of what it is for some aspect of an explanation to 'help carry the explanatory load', an analysis that is cast in difference-making terms.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=2\">Baron 2016:366</a>) \n\n\"I proceed to use the analysis to reform the indispensability argument so that, on the one hand, the argument does not imply a realist attitude toward idealizations, while, on the other hand, leaving an attitude of this kind open in the mathematical case.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=2\">Baron 2016:366</a>) \n\n\"I should also note that everything I say here is hostage to the provision of an account of mathematical difference-making. Providing such an account is beyond the scope of this paper. I aim merely to show that with such an account in hand, the indispensability argument has the ability to split the difference between mathematics and idealizations.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=2\">Baron 2016:366</a>) \n\n\"What does it meant to play an indispensable explanatory role in science? This is a difficult question and one that will concern us in much of what is to come. As a first pass, however, we can simply extend Colyvan's (2001, p. 77) standard notion of indispensability as follows. A proposition P is explanatorily dispensable to a theory T iff: ∗ (1) There exists a modification of T resulting in a second theory T with exactly the same observational consequences as T but in which P plays no role. (2) The explanatory power of T is greater than or equal to the explanatory power of T . P is therefore indispensable if one of these two conditions fails to hold.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=3\">Baron 2016:367</a>) \n\n\"The reason why I focus on the above version of the enhanced indispensability argument is that the difficulty idealizations pose is clearest when the debate is framed in terms of truth. That's because idealizations are not objects, they are, rather, (false) claims.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=3\">Baron 2016:367</a>) \n\n\"However, as Bokulich (2011) argues, models typically involve idealizations. Moreover, these idealizations often play an indispensable explanatory role in the models at issue.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=4\">Baron 2016:368</a>) \n\n\"Clearly, the mathematical realist does not want to accept that sharks lack memory capacities, that kettles contain an infinite number of molecules or that light is a ray, just because these idealizations boost the explanatory credentials of our best scientific theories, and indispensably so. The trouble is that the notion of explanatory power, when used to formulate the enhanced indispensability argument forces just such a commitment. So there is pressure on the mathematical realist to sharpen up the notion of explanatory indispensability and thereby break the symmetry between idealizations and mathematics.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=7\">Baron 2016:371</a>) \n\n\"First, we require a definition of explanatory load-carrying. I propose to understand this notion in terms of difference-making: Explanatory load A statement S that is (i) about some Fs and (ii) is a part of an explanation E of some phenomenon P is helping to carry the explanatory load iff F makes a difference to P.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=8\">Baron 2016:372</a>) \n\n\"Difference-making is, in turn, to be understood counterfactually: Difference-making F makes a difference to P iff had F not been the case, P would not have been the case. Where, according to the standard Lewis-Stalnaker semantics for counterfactuals: (i) iff there is some possible world in which both and that is closer to Φ Ψ Φ Ψ the actual world than any possible world in which but not Ψ . Φ\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=8\">Baron 2016:372</a>) \n\n\"Putting this together, then, a statement S that is (i) about some Fs and (ii) is a part of an explanation E of some phenomenon P, helps to carry the explanatory load in E just when there is counterfactual dependence of P on F.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=8\">Baron 2016:372</a>) \n\n\"Given the evidence, then, there is reason to believe that the memory capacity idealization is not load-carrying in the optimality explanation of random foraging behaviour in sharks, whereas prey density is. Batterman's rainbow case is similar.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"Similarly, when trying to explain why a phase transition occurs inside a boiling kettle, the number of H2O molecules makes no difference.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"In sum, the idealizations in these three cases do not help to carry the explanatory load because the features being idealized are explanatorily irrelevant to the phenomena we are trying to explain.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"First, it may turn out that including a particular idealization in a scientific model is necessary for that model to yield a particular explanandum.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"Idealizations, then, can play a 'scaffolding' role by facilitating the model-building process, without carrying the explanatory load in the resulting model.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"Second, it may be that if we don't make a particular idealization assumption, then we introduce unwanted information into an explanation, information that renders that explanation less virtuous along one or more dimensions (e.g. it may become less unified or less elegant).\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=10\">Baron 2016:374</a>) \n\n\"The enhanced indispensability argument* (B1) We ought to believe in the truth of any claim that indispensably helps to carry the explanatory load in our best scientific theories. (B2) Some mathematical claims indispensably help to carry the explanatory load in science. Therefore, (B3) We ought to believe in the truth of some mathematical claims.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=11\">Baron 2016:375</a>) \n\n\"A proposition P dispensably helps to carry the explanatory load in a theory T iff: ∗ (1) There exists a modification of T resulting in a second theory T with exactly the same observational consequences as T but in which P does not help to carry the explanatory load. (2) The explanatory power of T is greater than or equal to the explanatory power of T . P thus indispensably helps to carry the explanatory load if either condition fails to hold.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=11\">Baron 2016:375</a>) \n\n\"In what follows I will argue that—unlike idealizations—it is at least open that some mathematics is load-carrying, and thus that the enhanced indispensability argument* has the potential to cleave some mathematics from idealizations.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=11\">Baron 2016:375</a>) \n\n\"A wrinkle: building specific details about memory capacity into the case may make the model more accurate. However, accuracy is not (necessarily) a good thing. For accuracy may trade-off against explanatory power as, for instance, when a more accurate model is also less general (i.e. explains fewer instances of a phenomenon).\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=11\">Baron 2016:375</a>) \n\n\"we lack the right evidence to conclude against the difference-making potential of mathematics in at least some cases.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=12\">Baron 2016:376</a>) \n\n\"For if it turns out that there is no good account of difference-making and of explanatory load that will ground the distinction between idealizations and mathematics I am suggesting, then the symmetry between the two will not be broken and the enhanced indispensability argument* will founder. That said, if there are plausible accounts of mathematical difference-making and explanatory load-carrying to be had, then the symmetry will be broken, and the enhanced indispensability argument* will be immunised from further worries of this kind.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=12\">Baron 2016:376</a>) \n\n\"a statement carries the explanatory load in a scientific explanation of a physical phenomenon when the feature(s) that the statement is about make a difference to the relevant phenomenon. So when we are attempting to determine if an idealization is load-carrying we must check to see if the thing being idealized—the relevant feature of the world— is making a difference to the thing we are trying to explain. Consequently, assuming that mathematical statements are about mathematical objects, it follows that in order to determine whether those statements are carrying any of the explanatory load we must look to see if the features they are about make a difference to whatever it is we are trying to explain. This means looking at counterfactuals involving mathematical objects.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=12\">Baron 2016:376</a>) \n\n\"As previously discussed, in the case of idealizations we have evidence against counterfactuals of this kind, whereby a factor like memory capacity is perturbed. In the cicada case, we do not have the same evidence. We do not, for instance, have a range of actual cases in which the number 13 is factorised differently that we can investigate to determine whether cicadas with periodical life-cycle lengths still have 13-year life-cycles. Indeed, we could never have evidence of this kind against CF2. That's because, unlike alterations to memory capacity, the relevant changes to 13 are impossible to carry out, and so we won't see an actual range of cases involving alterations to 13 that is anything like the range of cases we have for memory capacity and foraging behaviour. But we do not have any further evidence against CF2 either. We have no reason from elsewhere in science, or from within mathematics to think that the number 13 is not making a difference to the life-cycle length of North American cicadas\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=13\">Baron 2016:377</a>) \n\n\"One might argue that we do, in fact, have evidence against 13 making a difference. We have, in particular, the following intuitions: intuitively, the world would be just as it is, empirically, were there no mathematical objects. It could even be argued that it is exactly intuitions of this kind that are supposed to provide general support for nominalism (especially a Field-style nominalism).\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=13\">Baron 2016:377</a>) \n\n\"This brief extension to the honeycomb case suggests the following method for generalising over to other cases of extramathematical explanation. In each such case we identify the mathematical objects at issue—geometrical figures, numbers, sets, groups and so on—and build these into counterfactuals. Evidence for/against these counterfactuals is evidence for/against these objects making a difference. If there is one such case in which it is open that mathematics is load-carrying—as I believe there is—then that is enough to begin teasing apart idealizations and mathematical claims.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=14\">Baron 2016:378</a>) \n\n\"But difference-making, it could be argued, is a causal concept. If, then, mathematical entities make a difference, then mathematical entities also possess causal powers. However, all parties to the debate over the indispensability argument agree that mathematical entities lack causal powers. It therefore follows that mathematical entities cannot be making a difference. So claims about them cannot be carrying the explanatory load. So there is no hope of breaking the symmetry between mathematics and idealizations in the manner I have suggested.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=15\">Baron 2016:379</a>) \n\n\"The point, however, is that we can have evidence against the relevant counterfactual, at least in principle. It's just that, as a matter of fact, we don't\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PW6IK4BF?page=20\">Baron 2016:384</a>)",

      "abstractNote": "Infinite idealizations appear in our best scientific explanations of phase transitions. This is thought by some to be paradoxical. In this paper I connect the existing literature on the phase transition paradox to work on the concept of indispensability, which arises in discussions of realism and anti-realism within the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mathematics. I formulate a version of the phase transition paradox based on the idea that infinite idealizations are explanatorily indispensable to our best science, and so ought to attract a realist attitude. I go on to offer a solution to the paradox by drawing a distinction between two types of indispensability: constructive and substantive indispensability. I argue that infinite idealizations are constructively indispensable to explanations of phase transitions, but not substantively indispensable. This helps to resolve the paradox, I maintain, since realist commitment tracks substantive, and not constructive, indispensability.",

While pure wave mechanics is an objectively deterministic physical theory with no probabilities, Everett sought to show how the theory might be understood as making the standard quantum statistical predictions as appearances to observers who were themselves described by the theory. We will consider his argument and how it depends on a particular notion of branch typicality. We will also consider responses to Everett and the relationship between typicality and probability. The suggestion will be that pure wave mechanics requires a number of significant auxiliary assumptions in order to make anything like the standard quantum predictions.",

For example, the elementary excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ (where m is an odd integer) have been predicted to obey abelian fractional statistics, with a phase $\\varphi$ associated with the exchange of two particles equal to $\\pi/m$. However, despite numerous experimental attempts, clear signatures of fractional statistics remain elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate abelian fractional statistics at filling factor $\\nu=1/3$ by measuring the current correlations resulting from the collision between anyons at a beam-splitter. By analyzing their dependence on the anyon current impinging on the splitter and comparing with recent theoretical models, we extract $\\varphi=\\pi/3$, in agreement with predictions.",

      "abstractNote": "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics are related to one another through the so-called \"thermodynamic limit\" in which, roughly speaking the number of particles becomes infinite. At critical points (places of physical discontinuity) this limit fails to be regular. As a result, the \"reduction\" of Thermodynamics to Statistical Mechanics fails to hold at such critical phases. This fact is key to understanding an argument due to Craig Callender to the effect that the thermodynamic limit leads to mistakes in Statistical Mechanics. I discuss this argument and argue that the conclusion is misguided. In addition, I discuss an analogous example where a genuine physical discontinuity - the breaking of drops - requires the use of infinite idealizations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper discusses the alleged reduction of Thermodynamics to Statistical Mechanics. It includes an historical discussion of J. Willard Gibbs' famous caution concerning the connections between thermodynamic properties and statistical mechanical properties—his so-called “Thermodynamic Analogies.” The reasons for Gibbs' caution are reconsidered in light of relatively recent work in statistical physics on the existence of the thermodynamic limit and the explanation of critical behavior using the renormalization group apparatus. A probabilistic understanding of the renormalization group arguments allows for a kind of unification of Gibbs' approach with contemporary understanding of the reduction problem.",

It examines two cases: first, briefly, the modeling of shock formation using the idealization of the continuum. Second, and in more detail, the breaking of droplets from the points of view of both analytic fluid mechanics and molecular dynamical simulations at the nano-level. It argues that the continuum idealizations are explanatorily ineliminable and that a full understanding of certain physical phenomena cannot be obtained through completely detailed, nonidealized representations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Kadanoff's assessment of these consequences is discussed. What he called the “extended singularity theorem” (that phase transitons only can occur in infinite systems) poses serious difficulties for philosophical interpretation of theories. Several responses are discussed. The resolution demands a philosophical rethinking of the role of mathematics in physical theorizing.",

In the philosophical literature, I believe, this concept has been widely misunderstood. In particular, a number of recent attempts to formulate what counts as an explantation for the possibility of universal behavior are misguided because they fail to properly understand what the explanandum is. A proper explanation involves recognizing that universality implies a kind of stability of behavior under perturbation. Furthermore, this stability itself requires explanation. I relate the explanation of the stability characteristic of universality to the autonomy of certain models or theories at continuum scales from those and scales of the molecular or atomic.",

      "abstractNote": "In his later writings, Wittgenstein developed, defended, and used alternative modes of explanation, similar to those Meno and other interlocutors of Socrates provide in the Platonic dialogues. The legitimacy of the pre-Socratic form of concept explanation in philosophy is demonstrated by the use Wittgenstein himself makes of it while introducing new terms in the course of his investigations. Wittgenstein's neologisms are among the philosophical terms introduced during the twentieth century that have had the widest use, in philosophy as well as in other disciplines. Wittgenstein's treatment of vagueness, although illuminating in several respects, might disappoint some contemporary philosophers interested in the subject. A family-resemblance concept has to be explained by means of examples or instances. Some instances of a family-resemblance concept might be more typical, in some sense of typicality, than others, but so might be instances of other kinds of concept.",

But if the sense of, E.G., \"three\" determines its reference, And at least two analyses of \"three\" are equally \"correct\" but assign it two different sets as its referent, Then the condition in the analyses that states that three is a set is a superfluous one, And numbers couldn't be sets at all. In a final section it is suggested that by substituting the word \"object\" for the word \"set\" a similar argument arises which can then be used to refute the identification of numbers with any given system of objects: to characterize the numbers is to characterize not a system of objects but an abstract structure which many systems of objects might exhibit.",

      "abstractNote": "The paper considers the problem of defining concepts within formal ontologies. A number of distinct modes of definition are identified, which represent alternative viewpoints on the classification of objects. The nature of these modes is examined and interactions and correlations between them are considered. This analysis is used to characterise a number of key problems that confront the attempt to analyse the meanings of natural language concepts by means of a precise formal ontology. Some proposals are made as to how these problems might be overcome. It is argued that specification of precise formal semantics requires clear separation between aspects of meaning that are based on different modes of classification. But, to provide an adequate ontological framework to describe the semantics of natural language terms, additional formal apparatus is required to synthesise their meaning by combining the different modes. This meta-level ontological formalism must articulate the interactions between the different modes.",

      "abstractNote": "The mathematical nature of modern physics suggests that mathematics is bound to play some role in explaining physical reality. Yet, there is an ongoing controversy about the prospects of mathematical explanations of physical facts and their nature. A common view has it that mathematics provides a rich and indispensable language for representing physical reality but that, ontologically, physical facts are not mathematical and, accordingly, mathematical facts cannot really explain physical facts. In what follows, I challenge this common view. I argue that, in modern natural science, mathematics is constitutive of the physical. Given the mathematical constitution of the physical, I propose an account of explanation in which mathematical frameworks, structures, and facts explain physical facts. In this account, mathematical explanations of physical facts are either species of physical explanations of physical facts in which the mathematical constitution of some physical facts in the explanans are highlighted, or simply explanations in which the mathematical constitution of physical facts are highlighted. In highlighting the mathematical constitution of physical facts, mathematical explanations of physical facts make the explained facts intelligible or deepen and expand the scope of our understanding of them. I argue that, unlike other accounts of mathematical explanations of physical facts, the proposed account is not subject to the objection that mathematics only represents the physical facts that actually do the explanation. I conclude by briefly considering the implications that the mathematical constitution of the physical has for the question of the unreasonable effectiveness of the use of mathematics in physics.",

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.",

The phase sequence is not a perturbation series in the adiabatic parameter ∊ because each γ(k) (except γ(0)) contains ∊ to infinite order. For spin-½ systems the iteration can be described in terms of the geometry of parallel transport round loops Ck on the hamiltonian sphere. Non-adiabatic effects (transitions) must cause the sequence of γ(k) to diverge. For spin systems with analytic H0(t) this happens in a universal way: the loops Ck are sinusoidal spirals which shrink as ∊k until k ~ ∊-1 and then grow as k!; the smallest loop has a size exp{-1/∊}, comparable with the non-adiabaticity.",

Such a basis, required to be smooth and parallel-transported, can be generated by an ‘exchange rotation’ operator resembling angular momentum. This is constructed from the four harmonic oscillators from which the two spins are made according to Schwinger's scheme. It emerges automatically that the phase factor accompanying spin exchange with the transported basis is just the Pauli sign, that is (−1)2S. Singlevaluedness of the total wavefunction, involving the transported basis, then implies the correct relation between spin and statistics. The Pauli sign is a geometric phase factor of topological origin, associated with non-contractible circuits in the doubly connected (and non-orientable) configuration space of relative positions with identified antipodes. The theory extends to more than two particles.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose a view of vagueness as a semantic property of names and predicates. All entities are crisp, on this semantic view, but there are, for each vague name, multiple portions of reality that are equally good candidates for being its referent, and, for each vague predicate, multiple classes of objects that are equally good candidates for being its extension. We provide a new formulation of these ideas in terms of a theory of granular partitions. We show that this theory provides a general framework within which we can understand the relation between vague terms and concepts and the corresponding crisp portions of reality. We also sketch how it might be possible to formulate within this framework a theory of vagueness which dispenses with the notion of truth-value gaps and other artifacts of more familiar approaches. Central to our approach is the idea that judgments about reality involve in every case (1) a separation of reality into foreground and background of attention and (2) the feature of granularity. On this basis we attempt to show that even vague judgments made in naturally occurring contexts are not marked by truth-value indeterminacy. We distinguish, in addition to crisp granular partitions, also vague partitions, and reference partitions, and we explain the role of the latter in the context of judgments that involve vagueness. We conclude by showing how reference partitions provide an effective means by which judging subjects are able to temper the vagueness of their judgments by means of approximations.",

      "abstractNote": "Intuitionistic logic provides an elegant solution to the Sorites Paradox. Its acceptance has been hampered by two factors. First, the lack of an accepted semantics for languages containing vague terms has led even philosophers sympathetic to intuitionism to complain that no explanation has been given of why intuitionistic logic is the correct logic for such languages. Second, switching from classical to intuitionistic logic, while it may help with the Sorites, does not appear to offer any advantages when dealing with the so-called paradoxes of higher-order vagueness. We offer a proposal that makes strides on both issues. We argue that the intuitionist’s characteristic rejection of any third alethic value alongside true and false is best elaborated by taking the normal modal system S4M to be the sentential logic of the operator ‘it is clearly the case that’. S4M opens the way to an account of higher-order vagueness which avoids the paradoxes that have been thought to infect the notion. S4M is one of the modal counterparts of the intuitionistic sentential calculus (IPC) and we use this fact to explain why IPC is the correct sentential logic to use when reasoning with vague statements. We also show that our key results go through in an intuitionistic version of S4M. Finally, we deploy our analysis to reply to Timothy Williamson’s objections to intuitionistic treatments of vagueness.",

      "abstractNote": "This article addresses the question whether supertasks are possible within the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The supertask under consideration consists of performing an infinite number of quantum mechanical measurements in a finite amount of time. Recent arguments in the physics literature claim to show that continuous measurements, understood as N discrete measurements in the limit where N goes to infinity, are impossible. I show that there are certain kinds of measurements in quantum mechanics for which these arguments break down. This suggests that there is a new context in which quantum mechanics, in principle, permits the performance of a supertask.",

      "abstractNote": "Symmetry considerations dominate modern fundamental physics, both inquantum theory and in relativity. Philosophers are now beginning todevote increasing attention to such issues as the significance ofgauge symmetry, quantum particle identity in the light of permutationsymmetry, how to make sense of parity violation, the role of symmetrybreaking, the empirical status of symmetry principles, and so forth.These issues relate directly to traditional problems in the philosophyof science, including the status of the laws of nature, therelationships between mathematics, physical theory, and the world, andthe extent to which mathematics suggests new physics., This entry begins with a brief description of the historical roots andemergence of the concept of symmetry that is at work in modernscience. It then turns to the application of this concept to physics,distinguishing between two different uses of symmetry: symmetryprinciples versus symmetry arguments. It mentions the differentvarieties of physical symmetries, outlining the ways in which theywere introduced into physics. Then, stepping back from the details ofthe various symmetries, it makes some remarks of a general natureconcerning the status and significance of symmetries in physics.",

      "abstractNote": "We argue that standard definitions of ‘vagueness’ prejudice the question of how best to deal with the phenomenon of vagueness. In particular, the usual understanding of ‘vagueness’ in terms of borderline cases, where the latter are thought of as truth-value gaps, begs the question against the subvaluational approach. According to this latter approach, borderline cases are inconsistent (i.e., glutty not gappy). We suggest that a definition of ‘vagueness’ should be general enough to accommodate any genuine contender in the debate over how to best deal with the sorites paradox. Moreover, a definition of ‘vagueness’ must be able to accommodate the variety of forms sorites arguments can take. These include numerical, total-ordered sorites arguments, discrete versions, continuous versions, as well as others without any obvious metric structure at all. After considering the shortcomings of various definitions of ‘vagueness’, we propose a very general non-question-begging definition.",

      "abstractNote": "Axiomatization is uncommon outside mathematics, partly for being often viewed as embalming, partly because the best-known axiomatizations have serious shortcomings, and partly because it has had only one eminent champion, namely David Hilbert (Math Ann 78:405–415, 1918). The aims of this paper are (a) to describe what will be called dual axiomatics, for it concerns not just the formalism, but also the meaning (reference and sense) of the key concepts; and (b) to suggest that every instance of dual axiomatics presupposes some philosophical view or other. To illustrate these points, a theory of solidarity will be crafted and axiomatized, and certain controversies in both classical and quantum physics, as well as in the philosophy of mind, will be briefly discussed. The upshot of this paper is that dual axiomatics, unlike the purely formal axiomatics favored by the structuralists school, is not a luxury but a tool helping resolve some scientific controversies.",

It is shown that calculations, performed as a direct application of the postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics (OQM), do not yield results consistent with experiments. Traditional treatments are summarized and criticized. The relation of the transitions to the continuum with the traditional quantum measurement problem is pointed out; we sum up and comment some contributions concerning this issue. It is shown that an approach based on the notion of spontaneous projections yields expressions of the transition probabilities similar to those obtained in the traditional way and new predictions which could be submitted to experimental tests.",

Our central question concerns this purported parity of reasoning: do people who defend the EIA make an appropriate use of the resources of Scientific Realism (in particular, IBE) to achieve platonism? (§2) We argue that just because a variety of different inferential strategies can be employed by Scientific Realists does not mean that ontological conclusions concerning which things we should be Scientific Realists about are arrived at by any inferential route which eschews causes (§3), and nor is there any direct pressure for Scientific Realists to change their inferential methods (§4). We suggest that in order to maintain inferential parity with Scientific Realism, proponents of EIA need to give details about how and in what way the presence of mathematical entities directly contribute to explanations (§5).",

      "abstractNote": "We have two aims. The main one is to expound the idea of renormalization in quantum field theory, with no technical prerequisites (Sections 2 and 3). Our motivation is that renormalization is undoubtedly one of the great ideas—and great successes—of twentieth-century physics. Also it has strongly influenced, in diverse ways, how physicists conceive of physical theories. So it is of considerable philosophical interest. Second, we will briefly relate renormalization to Ernest Nagel’s account of inter-theoretic relations, especially reduction (Section 4).",

They take the field, from a foundational perspective, too seriously.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=2\">Callender 2001:540</a>) \n\n\"The problem for foundations of statistical mechanics arises from the fact that not only do we have a thermodynamic description of our (say) sample of gas and its behaviour, but we also have a mechanical theory describing the behaviour of the entities that constitute the gas\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=2\">Callender 2001:540</a>) \n\n\"The thought underlying the above scheme stems from an obvious observation. Most people do not believe that the existence of the colours red and green refute classical mechanics, despite the fact that classical particles are neither red nor green. It would be a big mistake when reducing colour to physical terms to think particles must be literally red or green.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=3\">Callender 2001:541</a>) \n\n\"Irreversibility is either true on all levels or on none: it cannot emerge as if out of nothing, on going from one level to another\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=3\">Callender 2001:541</a>) \n\n\"My claim is that the majority of mainstream foundations of statistical mechanics, up to and including the present day, is also guilty of one or more of the above mistakes\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=3\">Callender 2001:541</a>) \n\n\"The main problem with this approach, well known from a century's discussion of Boltzmann's notorious H-Theorem, is that a monotonically increasing entropy is plainly inconsistent with an underlying classical dynamics.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=5\">Callender 2001:543</a>) \n\n\"In short, if S is a function of the dynamical variables of an individual system, then S cannot exhibit monotonic behaviour\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=5\">Callender 2001:543</a>) \n\n\"effectively a reductio of assumption A\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=5\">Callender 2001:543</a>) \n\n\"klar (1993), for\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NX7T82QB?page=5\">Callender 2001:543</a>) \n\n\"One of the principal reasons given for this common response is that it 'respects thermodynamics'.

It is never strict deduction that takes you from the fundamental equations at the beginning to a description of the facts at the end. Instead we use a variety of different approximations. It is with respect to these approximations that explanation and application differ\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=1\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:273</a>) \n\n\"Exactiy the opposite generally happens in application. We start with a general law, but approximations and alterations to it bring us closer to the truth, to what we actually measure or otherwise observe. When we want to figure how real systems will behave, usually the doctored results are better than the rigorous outcomes. In these cases the laws that we use help us to get around in the world, but they do not provide the sort of understanding that a D-N explanation is supposed to give. This has significant bearing on issues of scientific realism.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=2\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:274</a>) \n\n\"\"The inaccuracy is due to causal features, some known, some unknown, which are present in the actual transistor but missing from the model.\" This suggests that we construct a larger, more complex model that includes the missing features; then start with a new, better formula that fits the complex model. There are three drawbacks to this suggestion: 1) it is not possible to include theoretical factors in a model when the theory does not predict their existence; 2) if we could construct the more complex model, we are not guararteed that we will know any formula for it; and 3) if we could write such a formula, it would be highly specific to the amplifier in question and it would probably have no general applicability.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=4\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:276</a>) \n\n\"there is a clear sense in which this is ad hoc. There is no theoretical way to determine how much discrepency there will be, even from quantum theory.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=5\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:277</a>) \n\n\"It seems that a model is called an idealization when it is thought to be a simplification of what occurs in reality, usually a simplification that omits some relevant features, such as the extended mass of the planets or the descrepancy in resistance.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=5\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:277</a>) \n\n\"When more accuracy is called for, it can be achieved. Corrections can be made. But the way in which the corrections are made runs counter to the needs of explanation.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=5\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:277</a>) \n\n\"We will consider one last objection to our point of view before discussing the 2nd example. If circuit models are not explanatory theories at all, but are from the start just schemes for prediction, then the real explanation is the full quantum theory of transistors.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=5\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:277</a>) \n\n\"The short answer is that if explanations of mid band gain in our amplifier must be deduced from quantum theory, we have no explanation.

The consequence is an equation with exactly the desired features.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=7\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:279</a>) \n\n\"The second method, the Weisskopf-Wigner method, starts not from a pertur­ bation approximation but from an exact Schroedinger equation; yet it is an exact equation for an idealized situation.

The first notes that the possible states of the field are large in number and closely spaced. The approximation makes them continuous, and turns sums into integrals. Secondly, certain time integrals are taken to infinity. This is like setting the elapsed time equal to zero in the Markov treatment. Again, an exponential law is derived, and again the approximations are esential. If the states of the field were treated as discrete or the time integrals as finite—as in fact they are—the result would not be exponential.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=7\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:279</a>) \n\n\"But it is clear, from the derivations, that if there is to be exponential decay in nature, the approximations which we make on the Schroedinger equation must take us closer to, and not farther from the truth.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95P9VV5H?page=8\">Cartwright,Nordby 1983:280</a>)",

      "abstractNote": "Nancy Cartwright argues for a novel conception of the role of fundamental scientific laws in modern natural science. If we attend closely to the manner in which theoretical laws figure in the practice of science, we see that despite their great explanatory power these laws do not describe reality. Instead, fundamental laws describe highly idealized objects in models. Thus, the correct account of explanation in science is not the traditional covering law view, but the 'simulacrum' account. On this view, explanation is a matter of constructing a model that may employ, but need not be consistent with, a theoretical framework, in which phenomenological laws that are true of the empirical case in question can be derived. Anti-realism about theoretical laws does not, however, commit one to anti-realism about theoretical entities. Belief in theoretical entities can be grounded in well-tested localized causal claims about concrete physical processes, sometimes now called 'entity realism'. Such causal claims provide the basis for partial realism and they are ineliminable from the practice of explanation and intervention in nature.",

If we take seriously the practice of fitting facts into equations, the answer should be no. To give a mathematical description of a real phenomenon requires bridge principles.

The way to get this effect in the model is to set the potential at the walls to infinity.

      "abstractNote": "Conventional accounts like the deductive‐nomological model suppose that high‐level theories couched in abstract language encompass or imply more low‐level laws expressed in more concrete language (here called phenomenological laws). The truth of phenomenological laws is then supposed to provide evidence for the truth of the theory. This chapter argues that, to the contrary, approximations are required to arrive at phenomenological laws and generally these approximations improve on theory and are not dictated by the facts. Examples include an amplifier model, exponential decay and the Lamb shift (Based on work with Jon Nordby).",

      "abstractNote": "This paper defends the Quine-Putnam mathematical indispensability argument against two objections raised by Penelope Maddy. The objections concern scientific practices regarding the development of the atomic theory and the role of applied mathematics in the continuum and infinity. I present two alternative accounts by Stephen Brush and Alan Chalmers on the atomic theory. I argue that these two theories are consistent with Quine’s theory of scientific confirmation. I advance some novel versions of the indispensability argument. I argue that these new versions accommodate Maddy’s history of the atomic theory. Counter-examples are provided regarding the role of the mathematical continuum and mathematical infinity in science.",

In such an approach it is possible to argue that if a theorem contains more information than a given set of axioms, then it is impossible for the theorem to be derived from the axioms. In contrast with the traditional proof based on the paradox of the liar, this new viewpoint suggests that the incompleteness phenomenon discovered by Gödel is natural and widespread rather than pathological and unusual. © 1982 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",

      "abstractNote": "Whenever a quantum system undergoes a cyclic evolution governed by a slow change of parameters, it acquires a phase factor: the geometric phase. Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov–Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov–Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.",

We use a recent paper by Hud Hudson as a point of departure. Hudson argues that two objects moving continuously can coincide for all but the last moment of their histories and yet be separated in space at the end of this last moment. It turns out that Hudson’s construction does not deliver mathematically continuous motion, but the natural question then is whether there is any merit in the alternative definition of continuity that he implicitly invokes.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently a fascinating debate has been rekindled over whether vagueness is metaphysical or linguistic. That is, is vagueness an objective feature of reality or is it merely an artifact of our language? Bertrand Russell’s contribution to this debate is considered by many to be decisive. Russell suggested that it is a mistake to conclude that the world is vague simply because the language we use to describe it is vague. He argued that to draw such an inference is to commit “the fallacy of verbalism”. I argue that this is only a fallacy if we have no reason to believe that the world is as our language says. Since vagueness is apparently not eliminable from our language—a fact that Russell himself acknowledged—an indispensability argument can be launched for metaphysical vagueness. In this paper I outline such an argument.",

      "abstractNote": "\"Thought experiments are a means of imaginative reasoning that lie at the heart of philosophy, from the pre-Socratics to the modern era, and they also play central roles in a range of fields, from physics to politics. The Routledge Companion to Thought Experiments is an invaluable guide and reference source to this multifaceted subject. Comprising over 30 chapters by a team of international contributors, the Companion covers the following important areas: the history of thought experiments, from antiquity to the trolley problem and quantum non-locality; thought experiments in the humanities, arts, and sciences, including ethics, physics, theology, biology, mathematics, economics, and politics; theories about the nature of thought experiments; new discussions concerning the impact of experimental philosophy, cross-cultural comparison studies, metaphilosophy, computer simulations, idealization, dialectics, cognitive science, the artistic nature of thought experiments, and metaphysical issues. This broad ranging Companion goes backwards through history and sideways across disciplines. It also engages with philosophical perspectives from empiricism, rationalism, naturalism, skepticism, pluralism, contextualism, and neo-Kantianism to phenomenology. This volume will be valuable for anyone studying the methods of philosophy or any discipline that employs thought experiments, as well as anyone interested in the power and limits of the mind.\"–The publisher.

      "abstractNote": "In this paper we give an account of the rise and development of coalgebraic thinking in mathematics and computer science as an illustration of the way mathematical frameworks may be transformed. Originating in a foundational dispute as to the correct way to characterise sets, logicians and computer scientists came to see maximizing and minimizing extremal axiomatisations as a dual pair, each necessary to represent entities of interest. In particular, many important infinitely large entities can be characterised in terms of such axiomatisations. We consider reasons for the delay in arriving at the coalgebraic framework, despite many unrecognised manifestations occurring years earlier, and discuss an apparent asymmetry in the relationship between algebra and coalgebra.",

      "abstractNote": "Vagueness is ubiquitous in natural language. It seems incompatible with classical, bivalent logic, which tells us that every statement is either true or false, and none is vaguely true. Yet we do manage to reason using vague natural language. In fact, the majority of our day-to-day reasoning involves vague terms and concepts. There is a puzzle here: how do we perform this remarkable feat of reasoning? I argue that vagueness is a kind of semantic indecision. In short, that means we cannot say exactly who is bald and who is not because we have never decided the precise meaning of the word 'bald'–there are some borderline cases in the middle, which might be bald or might not. That is a popular general strategy for addressing vagueness. Those who use it, however, do not often say what they mean by 'borderline case'. It is most frequently used in a loose way to refer to in-between items: those people who are neither clearly bald nor clearly not bald. But under that loose description, the notion of borderline cases is ambiguous, and some of its possible meanings create serious problems for semantic theories of vagueness.Here, I clarify the notion of a borderline case, so that borderline cases can be used profitably as a key element in a successful theory of vagueness. After carefully developing my account of borderline cases, I demonstrate its usefulness by proposing a theory of vagueness based upon it. My theory, vagueness as permission, explains how classical logic can be used to model even vague natural language.",

      "abstractNote": "In The Explanatory Dispensability of Idealizations, Sam Baron suggests a possible strategy enabling the indispensability argument to break the symmetry between mathematical claims and idealization assumptions in scientific models. Baron’s distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical idealization, I claim, is in need of a more compelling criterion, because in scientific models idealization assumptions are expressed through mathematical claims. In this paper I argue that this mutual dependence of idealization and mathematics cannot be read in terms of symmetry and that Baron’s non-causal notion of mathematical difference-making is not effective in justifying any symmetry-breaking between mathematics and idealization. The function of making a difference that Baron attributes to mathematics cannot be referred to physical facts, but to the features of quantities, such as step lengths or time intervals taken into account in the models. It appears, indeed, that it does not follow from Baron’s argument that idealizations do not help to carry the explanatory load at least for two reasons: (1) mathematics is not independent of idealizations in modelling and (2) idealizations help mathematics to carry the explanatory load of a model in different degrees.",

      "abstractNote": "Studies in the field of psychology often employ (computerized) behavioral tasks, aimed at mimicking real-world situations that elicit certain actions in participants. Such tasks are for example used to study risk propensity, a trait-like tendency towards taking or avoiding risk. One of the most popular tasks for gauging risk propensity is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002), which has been shown to relate well to self-reported risk-taking and to real-world risk behaviors. However, despite its popularity and qualities, the BART has several methodological shortcomings, most of which have been reported before, but none of which are widely known. In the present paper, four such problems are explained and elaborated on: a lack of clarity as to whether decisions are characterized by uncertainty or risk; censoring of observations; confounding of risk and expected value; and poor decomposability into adaptive and maladaptive risk behavior. Furthermore, for every problem, a range of possible solutions is discussed, which overall can be divided into three categories: using a different, more informative outcome index than the standard average pump score; modifying one or more task elements; or using a different task, either an alternative risk-taking task (sequential or otherwise), or a custom-made instrument. It is important to make use of these solutions, as applying the BART without accounting for its shortcomings may lead to interpretational problems, including false-positive and false-negative results. Depending on the research aims of a given study, certain shortcomings are more pressing than others, indicating the (type of) solutions most needed. By combining solutions and openly discussing shortcomings, researchers may be able to modify the BART in such a way that it can operationalize risk propensity without substantial methodological problems.",

It is highly controversial what the nature of vagueness is - a feature of the way we represent reality in language, or rather a feature of reality itself? May even relations like identity or parthood be affected by vagueness? Sorites arguments suggest that vague terms are either inconsistent or have a sharp boundary. The account we give of such paradoxes plays a pivotal role for our understanding of natural languages. If our reasoning involves any vague concepts, is it safe from contradiction? Do vague concepts really lack any sharp boundary? If not, why are we reluctant to accept the existence of any sharp boundary for them? And what rules of inference can we validly apply, if we reason in vague terms? Cuts and Clouds presents the latest work towards a clearer understanding of these old puzzles about the nature and logic of vagueness. The collection offers a stimulating series of original essays on these and related issues by some of the world's leading experts.",

      "abstractNote": "Elay Shech and John Earman have recently argued that the common topological interpretation of the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect is unsatisfactory because it fails to justify idealizations that it presupposes. In particular, they argue that an adequate account of the AB effect must address the role of boundary conditions in certain ideal cases of the effect. In this paper I defend the topological interpretation against their criticisms. I consider three types of idealization that might arise in treatments of the effect. First, Shech takes the AB effect to involve an idealization in the form of a singular limit, analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical mechanics. But, I argue, the AB effect itself features no singular limits, so it doesn’t involve idealizations in this sense. Second, I argue that Shech and Earman’s emphasis on the role of boundary conditions in the AB effect is misplaced. The idealizations that are useful in connecting the theoretical description of the AB effect to experiment do interact with facts about boundary conditions, but none of these idealizations are presupposed by the topological interpretation of the effect. Indeed, the boundary conditions for which Shech and demands justification are incompatible with some instances of the AB effect, so the topological interpretation ought not justify them. Finally, I address the role of the non-relativistic approximation usually presumed in discussions of the AB effect. This approximation is essential if—as the topological interpretation supposes—the AB effect constrains and justifies a relativistic theory of the electromagnetic interaction. In this case the ends justify the means. So the topological view presupposes no unjustified idealizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Our model of time is the classical continuum of real numbers, and our model of other measurable quantities that change over time is that of functions defined on real numbers with real numbers as values. This model is not derived from reality or from our experience of it, but imposed on reality; and the fit is very imperfect. In classical mathematics, the value of a function for any real number as argument is independent of its value for any other argument: the analogue is Hume's doctrine that events are loose and separate. This makes continuity in the change of any quantity a contingent law of physica, rather than a conceptual necessity. The article explores alternatives to this classical model.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, I focus on an internal tension within James’s Principles and suggest that its formal structure provides useful insight into James’s subsequent evolution. Specifically, through a close reading of James’s account of ‘conceptions’ in the Principles, I examine the tension between these ‘conceptions’ construed as discrete and self-identical and James’s famous phenomenological description of consciousness as a continuous stream. Such a tension primarily involves the intersection of an epistemic need (or condition of possibility) with a quasi-metaphysical intuition or postulate (continuity). Importantly, this tension is intensified by the methodological constraints of bracketing metaphysical questions that James sets for himself in the Principles. James’s decision to deny the cogency of this methodological bracketing can therefore be read as his response to the tension I examine and his speculative turn to “radical empiricism” as an attempt to resolve epistemological difficulties by going more radical ontologically. Doing so raises questions about the status of speculative metaphysics in intersection with empirical inquiry.",

      "abstractNote": "Sorites is an ancient piece of paradoxical reasoning pertaining to sets with the following properties: (Supervenience) elements of the set are mapped into some set of “attributes”; (Tolerance) if an element has a given attribute then so are the elements in some vicinity of this element; and (Connectedness) such vicinities can be arranged into pairwise overlapping finite chains connecting two elements with different attributes. Obviously, if Superveneince is assumed, then (1) Tolerance implies lack of Connectedness, and (2) Connectedness implies lack of Tolerance. Using a very general but precise definition of “vicinity”, Dzhafarov & Dzhafarov (2010) offered two formalizations of these mutual contrapositions. Mathematically, the formalizations are equally valid, but in this paper, we offer a different basis by which to compare them. Namely, we show that the formalizations have different proof-theoretic strengths when measured in the framework of reverse mathematics: the formalization of (1) is provable in $RC{A_0}$ , while the formalization of (2) is equivalent to $AC{A_0}$ over $RC{A_0}$ . Thus, in a certain precise sense, the approach of (1) is more constructive than that of (2).",

      "abstractNote": "In 1894 Pierre Curie announced what has come to be known as Curie's Principle: the asymmetry of effects must be found in their causes. In the same publication Curie discussed a key feature of what later came to be known as spontaneous symmetry breaking: the phenomena generally do not exhibit the symmetries of the laws that govern them. Philosophers have long been interested in the meaning and status of Curie's Principle. Only comparatively recently have they begun to delve into the mysteries of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The present paper aims to advance the discussion of both of these twin topics by tracing their interaction in classical physics, ordinary quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The features of spontaneous symmetry that are peculiar to quantum field theory have received scant attention in the philosophical literature. These features are highlighted here, along with an explanation of why Curie's Principle, though valid in quantum field theory, is nearly vacuous in that context.",

      "abstractNote": "On standard accounts of scientific theorizing, the role of idealizations is to facilitate the analysis of some real world system by employing a simplified representation of the target system, raising the obvious worry about how reliable knowledge can be obtained from inaccurate descriptions. The idealizations involved in the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect do not, it is claimed, fit this paradigm; rather the target system is a fictional system characterized by features that, though physically possible, are not realized in the actual world. The point of studying such a fictional system is to understand the foundations of quantum mechanics and how its predictions depart from those of classical mechanics. The original worry about the use of idealizations is replaced by a new one; namely, how can actual world experiments serve to confirm the AB effect if it concerns the behavior of a fictional system? Struggle with this issue helps to account for the fact that almost three decades elapsed before a consensus emerged that the predicted AB effect had received solid experimental support. Standard accounts of idealizations tout the role they play in making tractable the analysis of the target system; by contrast, the idealizations involved in the AB effect make its analysis both conceptually and mathematically challenging. The idealizations required for the AB effect are also responsible for the existence of unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations and of the current algebra, representations which an observer confined to the electron’s configuration space could invoke to ‘explain’ AB-type effect without the need to posit a hidden magnetic field. The goal of this paper is to bring to the attention of the philosophers of science these and other aspects of the AB effect which are neglected or inadequately treated in literature.",

She concludes that when the fundamental laws of physics are true, they don't apply in the real world, but only in highly idealized counterfactual situations. In this paper, we argue that (1) and (2) together with an assumption about contraposition entail the opposite conclusion — that the fundamental laws of physics do apply in the real world. Cartwright extracts from her thesis about the inapplicability of fundamental laws the conclusion that they cannot figure in covering-law explanations. We construct a different argument for a related conclusion — that forward-directed idealized dynamical laws cannot provide covering-law explanations that are causal. This argument is neutral on whether the assumption about contraposition is true. We then discuss Cartwright's simulacrum account of explanation, which seeks to describe how idealized laws can be explanatory.",

      "abstractNote": "Many phenomena in the natural world are complex, so scientists study them through simplified and idealised models. Philosophers of science have sought to explain how these models relate to the world. On most accounts, models do not represent the world directly, but through target systems. However, our knowledge of target systems is incomplete. First, what is the process by which target systems come about? Second, what types of entity are they? I argue that the basic conception of target systems, on which other conceptions depend, is as parts of the world. I outline the process of target system specification and show that it is a crucial step in modelling. I also develop an account of target system evaluation, based on aptness. Paying close attention to target system specification and evaluation can help scientists minimise the frequency and extent of mistakes, when they are using models to investigate phenomena in complex real-world systems.",

      "abstractNote": "The paper argues that digital ontology (the ultimate nature of reality is digital, and the universe is a computational system equivalent to a Turing Machine) should be carefully distinguished from informational ontology (the ultimate nature of reality is structural), in order to abandon the former and retain only the latter as a promising line of research. Digital vs. analogue is a Boolean dichotomy typical of our computational paradigm, but digital and analogue are only “modes of presentation” of Being (to paraphrase Kant), that is, ways in which reality is experienced or conceptualised by an epistemic agent at a given level of abstraction. A preferable alternative is provided by an informational approach to structural realism, according to which knowledge of the world is knowledge of its structures. The most reasonable ontological commitment turns out to be in favour of an interpretation of reality as the totality of structures dynamically interacting with each other. The paper is the first part (the pars destruens) of a two-part piece of research. The pars construens, entitled “A Defence of Informational Structural Realism”, is developed in a separate article, also published in this journal.",

      "abstractNote": "One of the hardest problems in philosophy, one that has been around for over two thousand years without generating any significant consensus on its solution, involves the concept of vagueness: a word or concept that doesn't have a perfectly precise meaning. There is an argument that seems to show that the word or concept simply must have a perfectly precise meaning, as violently counterintuitive as that is. Unfortunately, the argument is usually so compressed that it is difficult to see why exactly the problem is so hard to solve. In this article I attempt to explain just why it is that the problem – the sorites paradox – is so intractable.",

      "abstractNote": "Science provides us with representations of atoms, elementaryparticles, polymers, populations, genetic trees, economies, rationaldecisions, aeroplanes, earthquakes, forest fires, irrigation systems,and the world’s climate. It’s through theserepresentations that we learn about the world. This entry exploresvarious different accounts of scientific representation, with aparticular focus on how scientific models represent theirtarget systems. As philosophers of science are increasinglyacknowledging the importance, if not the primacy, of scientific modelsas representational units of science, it’s important to stressthat how they represent plays a fundamental role in how we are toanswer other questions in the philosophy of science (for instance in thescientific realism debate). This entry begins by disentangling“the” problem of scientific representation, and then critically evaluates the current options available in theliterature.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper deals with vague predicates. In particular, the goal is to arrive at a precise characterisation of a vague predicate without begging the question against a particular theoretical account on the matter. For instance, such a characterisation should not exclude by fiat a theory that exploits the notion of gappy or glutty truth values. Furthermore, it should be neutral with respect to locating vagueness in epistemology or language. Following Bueno and Colyvan (2012), I argue in favour of characterising vagueness purely in terms of sorites susceptibility. However, I caution that the sorites argument can also be used to diagnose epistemic uncertainty of other sorts (or epistemic vagueness, according to Sauerland and Stateva, 2007) if we allow for partially ordered sets. This seems like an undesirable result as it captures phenomena which are fundamentally different than pure (scalar) vagueness. I argue that so-called borderline cases resulting from general epistemic uncertainty differ from those resulting from scalar vagueness and the sorites can be employed as a metric to tease these apart.",

          "note": "<h1>Annotations\n (27/10/2021, 12:47:48)</h1> \n\n“how can the contemplation of an imaginary scenario provide one with new true beliefs about contingent matters, and, assuming that it can do so, how are those new beliefs justified?” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1152) This is the \"hook\" of the paper: let's just do epistemology on thought experiments, see where it will get us. \n\n“. Nonetheless, there is a sharp divide among the participants that can be traced to the following questions: 1. Are the new beliefs that we form on the basis of the contemplation of imaginary scenarios actually formed as the result of inference from known premises to inductively or deductively implied conclusions? 2. To the extent that the new beliefs are not so formed, are they justified?” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1153) Is this a useful distinction? \n\n“Taken in full, both positions are extremely implausible:” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1153) I'm glad he doesn't say equally but man: Norton's view is not /that/ implausible is it \n\n“Rather, I will suggest, in the case of imaginary scenarios that evoke certain sorts of quasi-sensory intuitions, their contemplation may bring us to new beliefs about contingent features of the natural world that are produced not inferentially, but quasi-observationally; the presence of a mental image may play a crucial cognitive role in the formation of the belief in question.” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1154) Soooo, we create a mental model and \"see\" it play out in our minds, from which we can \"observe\" the outcomes and then in/de/abduce certain things? I wonder how much accepting this view depends on how your imagination works, and whether Norton has aphantasia or something \n\n“I will assume that to perform a thought experiment is to reason about an imaginary scenario with the aim of confirming or disconfirming some hypothesis or theory, and that to perform a scientific thought experiment is to reason about an imaginary scenario with the aim of confirming or disconfirming some hypothesis or theory about the physical world.5” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1154) Wonder what he will do with this distinction, does not sound /that/ useful \n\n“described at a greater level of specificity than that of the conclusion” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1155) Not something I would /necessarily/ associate with thought experiments, but interesting. \n\n“Norton and Brown disagree about which sorts of mental undertakings carry justificatory force, and, consequently, about the range of ways in which scientific thought-experimental reasoning could, in principle, give knowledge.” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1156) How does this involve a)? a) just says that in thought experiments yu reason about circumstances described at a greater level of specificity than the conclusion: what does that have to do with epistemology or inferential reasoning? It just says that you have stuff, you reason, and you have a conclusion. \n\n“It seems plausible to endorse a view according to which the particularity of the scenarios involved in thought-experimental reasoning supplies some epistemic force, while also accepting that the regularities to which scientific thought-experimental reasoning gives us access are contingent features of the natural world” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1156) How does thinking that \"the particularity of the scenarios involved supplies some epistemic force\" lead to siding with Brown? Is it because Norton claims that the conclusion of your thought experiment should be the same as long as it's \"an argument\"? Rather than the particular setting of the thought experiment aloowing us some priviliged epistemic access to... something? \n\n“We feel little hesitation in saying that you now know that four elephants wouldn’t fit comfortably in your neighbor’s living room, whereas you didn’t know it before” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1157) \n Good example, because usually when we talk about \"knowledge\" it is about things we know directly and all we can infer from it.\n If you here hooves in the distance, you don't /know/ whether it's zebras or horses. Are there cases similar to this, where you don't know something, you think for a bit, and then you know? The obvious example is math, but this sounds like points for Norton if anything. \n\n“four elephants, mentally arrayed them in the room, and tried to ascertain whether there was space for the four elephants within the confines of the room’s four walls. Of course, in many ways, the mental image you formed was unspecified:” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1157) I think aphantasia is a good counter argument to this: surely people without this abilitiy could still do thought experiments? Just simple \"what if\" things could still work. \n\n“you presumably invoked a mental image of the room (using memory), and—holding constant your affordance-based sense of its dimensions—evoked a quasiproprioceptive image of the experience of riding a bicycle in a space” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1157) Let us do a thought experiment ourselves of someone without this ability: this person could still perform this thought experiment if they made an estimate of how large the room was, how large an average elephant is, and do more of a Fermi-estimate of whether it is possible to ride an elephant there. \n\n“But is that really what happened? My inclination is to think not. Rather, what happened is that formed a judgment on the basis of your manipulation of your mental image, and—using that new information—went on to draw your conclusion about the more general statement for which you took it to be evidence.” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) I think it really depends on the person's mental faculties (that sounds mean) whether that is plausible or not. \n\n“wouldn’t you proceed by putting the elephants into the room, and seeing whether they fit? Suppose I took away the third and fourth elephants before you managed to place them in the room. Would your imaginary continuation of the process you had begun really be a process of deductive reasoning?” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) Okay good point, I also doubt that someone would not be able to continue that, butttt maybe they did? The question of whether this \"putting things in a thing and see if it fits\" is \"deductive reasoning\" is interesting though, but I don't see how those are per se incompatible. Although, yes, you're not really deductively reasoning, even though it could be modeled as such. \n\n(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \n Is the \"elephant\" example even a good thought experiment, comparable with Galileo's balls? One difference is that the new knowledge in this case is very similar to knowledge we already have: the question is not whether big things can sometimes fit into smaller things, but whether the things are bigger than the other. GBalls was about whether heavy things fall faster than slow things /in general/. Maybe a comparable thing would be the standard math problem of a train traveling by x km/s vs a train traveling by y km/s: which arrives earlier? Sure, given vague data (elephants, room) we need to do some more work to get to the conclusion, but it's not really /interesting/ because we could have easily figured it out with more data. Of course, galileo could have just dropped some balls, but he did have some actual constraints (such as air resistance) and his conclusion is much more general. \n\n(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) Maybe the conclusion is: thought experiments are different things for different people? That is a bit boring. \n\n“Research by Roger Shepard and others has shown that judgments about topological similarity are generally made after engaging in the mental manipulation of an image: the greater the degree of rotation required to project one onto the other, the longer it takes to judge whether two figures are isomorphic” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \n Interesting example about intuitive reasoning, but are they really /thought experiments?/ Or, to play nicely, should this be counted as performing a thought experiment? By their criteria it does, but maybe their criteria are not stringent enough? One possible criteria: a thought experiment is an experiment you either cannot do or cannot generalize when done physically. Then the topological similarity does sort of count, but I kind of struggle with congrueing mathematics and \"experimenting\" lol \n\n“do we really want to say that the belief was formed by deductive or inductive reasoning” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1160) Is imagining a scenario and then forming a belief from it really a thought experiment? I find this idea a bit too general, but don't have a convincing enough argument against it. \n\n“As before, it’s hard to see why we would want to say that this new justified true belief (that the rotated image resembles Texas) was formed by inductive or deductive reasoning from known premises.” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1161) Decent point. The answer to \"How do you infer that this image is Texas?\" is not a step by step process. BUT: this is more saying something about \"perception\" than how a thought experiment works. I guess the one thing you can say is that the setup of  a thought experiment (if you could call this one) does have a lot of impact on the conclusions we draw from it. \n\n“This belief is produced not inferentially, but quasi-observationally: the presence of the mental image plays a crucial cognitive role in its formation.” (Gendler, 2004, p. 1162) I think this point is really hard to disagree with: the imaginative component is very powerful, and what we are doing when we perform a thought experiment is much more akin to \"intuiting\" than \"deducing\".",

This is followed by an extensive discussion of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, both for spins in single-layer systems and `pseudospins' in double-layer systems. The effective field theories describing various broken symmetry states and `skyrmion' and `meron' spin textures are derived and discussed in some detail. Pedagogical presentations on Berry phases and lowest Landau level projection are included in appendices.",

      "abstractNote": "It is usual to identify initial conditions of classical dynamical systems with mathematical real numbers. However, almost all real numbers contain an infinite amount of information. I argue that a finite volume of space can’t contain more than a finite amount of information, hence that the mathematical real numbers are not physically relevant. Moreover, a better terminology for the so-called real numbers is “random numbers”, as their series of bits are truly random. I propose an alternative classical mechanics, which is empirically equivalent to classical mechanics, but uses only finite-information numbers. This alternative classical mechanics is non-deterministic, despite the use of deterministic equations, in a way similar to quantum theory. Interestingly, both alternative classical mechanics and quantum theories can be supplemented by additional variables in such a way that the supplemented theory is deterministic. Most physicists straightforwardly supplement classical theory with real numbers to which they attribute physical existence, while most physicists reject Bohmian mechanics as supplemented quantum theory, arguing that Bohmian positions have no physical reality.",

      "abstractNote": "Linguistic vagueness is a consequence of aggregating many judgments into one. One of the distinguishing features of a vague linguistic predicate like heap is its susceptibility to the “sorites paradox”: if 10,000 grains of sand makes a heap, and if a heap of sand minus one grain is a heap, then pile of 1 grain is a heap. Yet whether something is a heap depends on judgments along at least two dimensions, height and width. Vague linguistic predicates, including gradable adjectives like tall, have this judgment-aggregating character. Results from social choice theory—a branch of economics dealing with collective decision making—show that judgment aggregations face significant limitations. Semantically, these limitations manifest as vagueness effects like susceptibility to the sorites paradox.",

      "abstractNote": "When it comes to Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics, even sympathetic admirers are cowed into submission by the many criticisms of influential authors in that field. They say something to the effect that Wittgenstein does not know enough about or have enough respect for mathematics, to take him as a serious philosopher of mathematics. They claim to catch Wittgenstein pooh-poohing the modern set-theoretic extensional conception of a real number. This article, however, will show that Wittgenstein's criticism is well grounded. A real number, as an ‘extension’, is a homeless fiction; ‘homeless’ in that it neither is supported by anything nor supports anything. The picture of a real number as an ‘extension’ is not supported by actual practice in calculus; calculus has nothing to do with ‘extensions’. The extensional, set-theoretic conception of a real number does not give a foundation for real analysis, either. The so-called complete theory of real numbers, which is essentially an extensional approach, does not define (in any sense of the word) the set of real numbers so as to justify their completeness, despite the common belief to the contrary. The only correct foundation of real analysis consists in its being ‘existential axiomatics’. And in real analysis, as existential axiomatics, a point on the real line need not be an ‘extension’.",

      "abstractNote": "Scientific explanation and causation are two of the most enduring topics of debate in the philosophy of science. Michael Strevens' extraordinary 500-page tome, Depth, constitutes the latest addition to both of these venerable and vital debates. Strevens identifies his book as a contribution to work on the nature of explanation; however, his theory of explanation purports to teach us important and surprising new things about causation as well. Depth thus commands the attention of today's philosophers of science, because of the importance of these two issues, and also because of Strevens' impressive intellectual talents. Depth has five main parts. In what follows, we first give a brief summary of what we take to be the most important and interesting points in each of these. Then we offer two criticisms, one aimed generally at Strevens' methodology and one aimed specifically at some of the book's content. In Part I (\"The Causal Approach to Explanation\"), Strevens makes some important preliminary clarifications and then offers an admittedly colored overview of recent accounts of explanation and high-level causation. Strevens notes that he is interested in analyzing explanation in an ontological sense, such that \"explanation [is] something out in the world, a set of facts to be discovered\" (p. 6). Additionally, he focuses his project so that its aim is \"purely descriptive\" (p. 37). In pursuit of this project, Strevens advocates a \"two-factor causal account of explanation.\" That is, as opposed to giving an account of causation and positing that any causal influence on an effect e thereby is a necessary part of the full explanation for e (a \"one-factor approach\"), Strevens asserts that the explanation of e is only made up of those causal influences of e that pass a second test for \"explanatory relevance.\"[1] This second factor ultimately is supposed to single out those causal influences that \"make a difference\" to the occurrence of e. Strevens introduces his Kairetic account to serve this purpose. Part II (\"The Kairetic Account of Explanation\") details Strevens' account of difference-making, works this account into a fuller theory of event explanation, and then extends and applies this theory in several interesting ways. The Kairetic account attempts to extract a set of difference-makers from any veridical causal model for the explanandum event e. A veridical causal model is a set of true statements that causally entails the occurrence of e, where a set of statements causally entails that e occurs just in case the derivation of the occurrence of e from those statements \"mirrors a part of the causal process by which e was produced\" (p. 72). Given any veridical causal model for e then, the Kairetic account uncovers the corresponding difference-makers for e by locating the veridical causal model that is an abstraction of the original causal model[2] which optimizes a set of three desiderata: generality, cohesion, and accuracy. Strevens calls any model that is the end result of this procedure an explanatory kernel for e. Additionally, he claims that any explanatory kernel for e will necessarily be made up entirely of difference-makers for e. Pertaining to explanation then, Strevens asserts that a causal model is a complete explanation of an event \"just in case it is an explanatory kernel for that event … The optimizing procedure constructs standalone [complete] explanations\" (p. 117). In other words, a statement may be said to explain (partially) the occurrence of an event e only if that statement is a member of some explanatory kernel for e. Strevens then applies his Kairetic account to the causation debate through his maxim that \"causal claims … are causal-explanatory claims\" (p. 4). Typically, theories of causal explanation give causal claims priority over the explanatory; one discovers the explanation of e by first deciding on the high-level causes of e – i.e., those which render the statement that c caused e true. For Strevens, on the other hand, explanatory facts are prior to causal claims; statements that c caused e are shorthand for c is part of a causal explanation for the occurrence of e. With this understanding of causal claims, Strevens strives to show that many well-known puzzles and problems of causation dissolve. These include cases of preemption, cases where absences act as causes, and puzzles involving transitivity. In Part III (\"Explanation of Laws and Regularities\"), Strevens shows how the Kairetic account of explanation can be made to apply to the explanations of statements of regularity (including laws). In short, where e represents any event that is an instance of the regularity in question, one explains that regularity by citing the explanatory kernel of e minus any initial conditions specific to e. Strevens calls this part of an explanatory kernel the causal mechanism and he offers the following fundamental theorem: \"The explanation of a causal generalization [regularity] and the explanation of any instance of the generalization invoke the same causal mechanism\" (p. 223). Importantly, Strevens points out that, in many cases, high-level structures and patterns cited by statements of regularity (e.g., water, sexual reproduction in plants and animals on earth, Ford Pintos, etc.) are not cited by the causal mechanism appearing in the corresponding regularity explanation. In such a case, a basing generalization is necessary to make explicit the correspondence between the facts cited by the causal mechanism and those structural patterns (e.g., \"All water is H2O\"). There are several criteria that any such basing generalization must meet; most importantly, it must specify a relation of entanglement: F is entangled with P if \"All Fs have P\" is true and has sufficient scope, and if it is not true that \"if such and such an object with F had not had F, it would still have had P\" (p. 242). The notion of entanglement is, as Strevens points out, relatively weak insofar as it may be satisfied in the case that F is not responsible for bringing P about in any way. Lastly in Part III, Strevens uses his Kairetic account of regularity explanation to give a fascinating account of the role of idealization in science. The Kairetic account of event explanation that Strevens develops in Part II is deterministic in the sense that any causal model under consideration must causally entail that the explanandum of interest e occurs. Thus, in Part IV (\"Probabilistic Explanation\"), Strevens considers the alternative case in which one may usefully give a probabilistic explanation of e. This section is far and away the most laborious for the careful reader as Strevens offers a taxonomy of probability[3] and accounts for probabilistic explanation in distinct ways depending upon the type of probability involved. For reasons of space, it is impossible for this review to summarize this part in greater detail. Suffice it to say that the rewards that come out of reading these chapters make a careful read worth the effort. Two of the most interesting conclusions that Strevens defends in these chapters are: (1) The size of a probability (or of a change in probability) cited in an explanation does make a difference to the goodness of that explanation; and (2) it is often better to explain a phenomenon probabilistically than deterministically – even, in some cases, when that phenomenon is deterministically produced. Part V (\"Valediction\") is very brief, only 17 pages long. In it Strevens demonstrates some of the key points from Parts I through IV by looking at specific puzzles of explanation that arise in some of the special sciences. And, lastly, he very briefly discusses the aesthetic features of, and rewards for, successful explanation. Now on to our objections. As noted above, in the opening sections, Strevens focuses his project in several ways. First, he is interested in accounting for explanation in an ontological sense, such that \"explanation [is] something out in the world, a set of facts to be discovered\" (p. 6). Strevens distinguishes this sense of explanation from the sense of explanation as a \"means of communicating scientific knowledge.\" Second, Strevens focuses his project so that his aim is \"purely descriptive:\" the goal is \"to say what kinds of explanations we give and why we give them\" (p. 37). In pursuing this descriptive goal, Strevens appropriately recognizes that his \"most important source of evidence\" is the use of explanation in scientific practice itself (p. 37). This descriptive goal is distinguished from the normative goal of evaluating explanatory practice. These two fundamental clarifications of Strevens' account seem, at least prima facie, to be at odds with each other. By pursuing a purely descriptive goal, one most directly connects with the sense of explanation as a means of communication; after all, a descriptive account tries to describe what is distinctive about those theories that scientists communicate as being explanatory. Similarly, when one examines actual and historical explanatory practice in the scientific literature, one directly accumulates evidence about how scientists communicate scientific knowledge. Thus, it would seem that Strevens' descriptive goal is best achieved in terms of the concept of explanation as a communicative act. Additionally, the observation of scientific practice would seem to be a potentially odd first choice of evidence if one is interested in spelling out an ontological sense of explanation, according to which scientists can often be wrong about their explanatory claims and practices. Epistemological and logical analysis, along with strong explanatory intuitions, would seem to be a more suitable first line of evidence. Thankfully, in the end, it seems that Strevens actually makes much wider use of explanatory intuitions and epistemological and logical analysis than he wants to admit. After all, a certain \"Rasputin\" thought experiment upon which he continually draws throughout the entire book is far from a historical example drawn from \"the explanations regarded as scientifically adequate.\" Variations of this and other case studies are intended to pump clear and useful intuitions about the concept of explanation. And Strevens shows himself to be quite capable of strong and sound philosophical analysis. This distance from purely descriptive observations of scientific practice enables Strevens to say much that is useful to the analysis of the ontological sense of explanation. It is difficult to accept that Strevens is only attempting a descriptive account of explanatory practice for at least one more reason. Aside from observing historical accounts of explanation, there is at least one more utterly crucial source of evidence for any purely descriptive account of any human practice: psychology. While Strevens pays lip service to this line of evidence by citing it as \"a possible third source of evidence\" (p. 38), he actually utilizes this source only once throughout all of Depth (p. 259). Moreover, the absence of such material does not immediately present itself as a glaringly obvious defect of the book. Our suggestion is that this is because Strevens' study differs from the purely descriptive project that he sets out in his introductory chapter. For all of these reasons, it becomes unclear why Strevens' account should not be interpreted as a normative analysis of explanation. He sells his account as purely descriptive but his choices of method tell otherwise. The upshot to this first objection, then, can be phrased as a dilemma for Strevens. Either he is wrong or right that his is a purely descriptive project. If the former, then Strevens' account is actually doing something different than what he suggests. Instead of saying what kinds of explanations we do in fact give and why we give them, it is telling us what kinds of explanations we ought to give. This is only a problem insofar as Strevens is confused in his introductory chapter about the upshot of his project. On the other hand, if the latter horn of the dilemma holds true so that Strevens insists that his is a purely descriptive account, then the problem arises that he seems to be using the wrong toolbox of resources in pursuing his project. This is a far more serious problem. A second objection: As large as Strevens' book is, his project is much larger; consequently a lot of important details go missing and promissory notes are written. In many ways, this is a blessing. After all, 500-plus pages of dense analytical philosophy of science is enough for one book, as elegant and enjoyable as the prose may be. Also, many new interesting and promising lines of research are opened to Strevens' devotees who desire to fill out the details wanting in Depth. But the absence of detail turns out, in some places, to be rather a curse for the theory as a whole. In order to show this, we focus here on the absence of detail pertaining to the three central desiderata to the Kairetic account of difference-making: generality, cohesion, and accuracy. Recall that the explanation of any event or regularity is, in part, the causal model that constitutes the optimal combination of these three factors. In addition, Strevens clarifies that these desiderata can often interact and compete with one another forcing one to make tradeoffs between them (e.g., A certain causal model may not be the most accurate relative to the explanandum e, but it may still be the explanation of e if its lack of accuracy is made up for by its great generality; see section 5.2). Important questions thus immediately arise when one wants to apply the Kairetic account: What more precisely are generality, cohesion, and accuracy? How do we go about measuring the degree to which a causal model has any one of these factors (so that we can make sense of phrases like \"great generality\" or \"very little cohesion\")? How do we go about combining and comparing these three desiderata in order to go about choosing among various candidate explanations? These are absolutely necessary questions for giving the Kairetic account substance – i.e., for being able to apply and test the Kairetic account. But Strevens unfortunately stops short of fully answering them. Strevens does give some clarification in each case. For instance, regarding deterministic explanations, we learn at least the following: Generality has to do with the level of abstractness of a causal model; i.e., it counts the breadth of the space of possible systems for which the causal model would be veridical (p. 110). Defining cohesion is a complex and seemingly qualitative affair. Essentially, it seems for Strevens that a causal model either is or is not cohesive and that cohesion is equivalent to a notion of causal contiguity: \"A model is cohesive, I propose, if its realizers constitute a contiguous set in causal similarity space, or, as I will say, when its realizers are causally contiguous\" (p. 104).[4] Lastly, the accuracy of a causal model with respect to explanandum e is a measure of the similarity between that model's target (the conclusion causally entailed by the set of statements in the causal model) and the statement that e occurs (p. 142).[5] However, Strevens leaves unspecified just how the Kairetic account would have us measure the degree of similarity between two statements. Notably, none of these clarifications leave us with the answers to our previous questions that we need. Instead, we are given hints of measures, but no measures. We are given definitions that seem hopelessly complex. For the Kairetic account to be more substantive then, there is much work to be done. And how, we may ask, will Strevens' account fare if this work is successfully achieved? It is not clear that, if one were able to clarify the nuts and bolts of Strevens' Kairetic account, it would not then be self-defeating. Without trying to fill out the details (after all, that would be a wildly complex affair), it seems plausible that an account like, for example, Woodward's manipulationist account is much more general than Strevens' account – there are fewer details needed in order to account for our explanatory practice – while being at worst only slightly less accurate. But then, if we accept Strevens' account, it would seem quite feasible that we would be thereby obliged immediately to reject it in favor of this slightly less accurate, but more general account – given that Strevens' account mandates accuracy/generality tradeoffs. That is, it is quite plausible that a successfully clarified version of Strevens' account of explanation mandates its own rejection.[6] Clearly then, the precise details of generality, cohesion, and accuracy very much need to be filled out, not only to give the Kairetic account more substance but also to render it defensible against this charge. We have offered here a quick summary of Strevens' impressive book, Depth, along with two general objections to the account of scientific explanation given therein. Neither of these objections are put forward here with the aim of attacking Strevens' theory so much as with the aim of pointing to certain fundamental components of the theory that stand in serious need of further clarification. Moreover, our critical comments here are not meant to take away from our general endorsement of the book. Depth provides many intellectually stimulating and highly original thoughts on a number of critical and venerable philosophical topics. Any philosopher of science today will surely find it to be a rewarding read. [1] Pertaining to the nature of causation and causal influences, Strevens offers the ecumenical suggestion that most of the extant accounts of causation (including conserved quantity, counterfactual, and manipulation accounts) can accommodate the minimal assumptions about causality needed to fit our causal explanatory practice, and thus that we need not commit to a particular account of causation when analyzing explanation. [2] An abstraction of the original model: (1) only references causal influences mentioned in the original model, and (2) contains only statements that are entailed by statements contained in the original model. [3] This taxonomy as well as much of the conceptual groundwork for this section of Depth is taken from Strevens' previous book, Bigger than Chaos (Harvard UP, 2003). [4] In order to avoid the challenge of defining and finding similarity spaces, Strevens introduces a necessary but insufficient condition for causal contiguity that acts as a test for cohesion: dynamic contiguity: \"Take the trajectories corresponding to every one of a model's concrete realizers, each a thread in state space. If this set of state space threads is contiguous, the model is dynamically contiguous\" (p. 105). [5] Or, in the case that the causal model causally entails a range of possibilities, the accuracy is a measure of the similarity between the statement that e occurs and the member of this range of possibilities that is most dissimilar to e. [6] Of course, this argument that Strevens' account may be self-defeating only holds if this account can itself be interpreted as providing an explanation of explanatory practice. This assumption seems warranted given Strevens' descriptive aim \"to say what kinds of explanations we give and why we give them\" (p. 37; emphasis ours).",

In response to Busch and Morrison, I argue that nominalists can rebut the EIA while still accepting Baker’s form of IBE. Nominalists can plausibly require that defenders of the EIA establish the indispensability of a particular mathematical entity. Next, I argue that IBE cannot establish that any particular mathematical entity is indispensable. Mathematical entities do not compete with each other in the way physical unobservables do. This lack of competition enables alternative formulations of scientific explanations that use different, but compatible, mathematical entities. The compatibility of these explanations prevents IBE from establishing platonism.",

      "abstractNote": "The sorites paradox originated in an ancient puzzle that appears to begenerated by vague terms, viz., terms with unclear(“blurred” or “fuzzy”) boundaries ofapplication. ‘Bald’, ‘heap’,‘tall’, ‘old’, and ‘blue’ areprime examples of vague terms: no clear line divides people who arebald from people who are not, or blue objects from green (hence notblue), or old people from middle-aged (hence not old). Because thepredicate ‘heap’ has unclear boundaries, it seems that nosingle grain of wheat can make the difference between a number ofgrains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,since one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that twograins do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. Thisreasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains ofwheat make a heap. , The same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. DorothyEdgington observes:, The puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modusponens: , The argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning fromapparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can berun equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that onemillion grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, thenone million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less onegrain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.It follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thussoritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains makea heap and that any number of grains make a heap., What conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is theresomething wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use ofvague predicates really lead to absurdity?[1] In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all thetime, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,most theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,i.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discoverthe defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attemptsto solve it.",

This paper argues that this characterization can in fact be sharpened in various ways, giving rise to different conceptions of finitism. The paper investigates these conceptions and shows that they sanction different portions of mathematics as finitistic.",

The equilibrium states of a thermal system are assumed to be represented by a differentiable manifold of dimensionn + 1 (n finite). The empirical temperature is defined by the notion of thermal equilibrium. Empirical entropy is shown to exist for all systems with the property that the total work delivered along closed adiabats is zero. Absolute entropy and temperature follow from the additivity of heat and energy for two separate systems in thermal equilibrium considered as a whole. The absolute temperature is defined up to a multiplicative constant. The exterior differentiable calculus of Cartan is introduced and in a subsequent paper its use for the derivation of standard results in thermostatics will be explained.",

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting \"subjective statistical mechanics,\" the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.",

The series will consider a group of related concepts derived from condensed matter and statistical physics. The key technical ideas go under the names of “singularity”, “order parameter”, “mean field theory”, “variational method”, “correlation length”, “universality class”, “scale changes”, and “renormalization”. The first four of these will be considered here.",

      "abstractNote": "The renormalization method is specifically aimed at connecting theories describing physical processes at different length scales and thereby connecting different theories in the physical sciences. The renormalization method used today is the outgrowth of 150 years of scientific study of thermal physics and phase transitions. Different phases of matter show qualitatively different behaviors separated by abrupt phase transitions. These qualitative differences seem to be present in experimentally observed condensed-matter systems. However, the “extended singularity theorem” in statistical mechanics shows that sharp changes can only occur in infinitely large systems. Abrupt changes from one phase to another are signaled by fluctuations that show correlation over infinitely long distances, and are measured by correlation functions that show algebraic decay as well as various kinds of singularities and infinities in thermodynamic derivatives and in measured system parameters. Renormalization methods were first developed in field theory to get around difficulties caused by apparent divergences at both small and large scales. However, no renormalization gives a fully satisfactory formulation of field theory. The renormalization (semi-)group theory of phase transitions was put together by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1971 based upon ideas of scaling and universality developed earlier in the context of phase transitions and of couplings dependent upon spatial scale coming from field theory. Correlations among regions with fluctuations in their order underlie renormalization ideas. Wilson's theory is the first approach to phase transitions to agree with the extended singularity theorem. Some of the history of the study of these correlations and singularities is recounted, along with the history of renormalization and related concepts of scaling and universality. Applications, particularly to condensed-matter physics and particle physics, are summarized. This note is partially a summary of a talk given at the workshop “Part and Whole” in Leiden during the period March 22–26, 2010.",

      "abstractNote": "Braid theory and knot theory are related via two famous results due to Alexander and Markov. Alexander's theorem states that any knot or link can be put into braid form. Markov's theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions to conclude that two braids represent the same knot or link. Thus, one can use braid theory to study knot theory and vice versa. In this book, the author generalizes braid theory to dimension four. He develops the theory of surface braids and applies it to study surface links. In particular, the generalized Alexander and Markov theorems in dimension four are given. This book is the first to contain a complete proof of the generalized Markov theorem. Surface links are studied via the motion picture method, and some important techniques of this method are studied. For surface braids, various methods to describe them are introduced and developed: the motion picture method, the chart description, the braid monodromy, and the braid system. These tools are fundamental to understanding and computing invariants of surface braids and surface links. Included is a table of knotted surfaces with a computation of Alexander polynomials. Braid techniques are extended to represent link homotopy classes. The book is geared toward a wide audience, from graduate students to specialists. It would make a suitable text for a graduate course and a valuable resource for researchers.",

      "abstractNote": "We clarify the physical origin of anomalies in transverse resistivity often observed in exotic materials, such as SrRuO3, in which the Berry curvature is manifested in the transport properties. The previously attributed mechanism for the anomalies, the topological Hall effect (THE) [e.g., J. Matsuno et al., Sci. Adv. 2, e160030 (2016)], is refuted by our thorough investigations as well as formulation of a model considering inhomogeneous magnetoelectric properties in the material. Our analyses fully explain every feature of the anomalies without resorting to the THE. The present results establish a fundamental understanding, which was previously overlooked, of magnetotransport properties in such exotic materials.",

      "abstractNote": "Topological phases of matter are a potential platform for the storage and processing of quantum information with intrinsic error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and with the length scales of the system, such as the distance between quasiparticles. However, it is less well-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian quasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or Berry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid, with faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show that such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of topologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements that detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this source of error.",

      "abstractNote": "Several modern accounts of explanation acknowledge the importance of abstraction and idealization for our explanatory practice. However, once we allow a role for abstraction, questions remain. I ask whether the relation between explanations at different theoretical levels should be thought of wholly in terms of abstraction, and argue that changes of the quantities in terms of which we describe a system can lead to novel explanations that are not merely abstractions of some more detailed picture. I use the example of phase transitions as described by statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to illustrate this, and to demonstrate some details of the relationship between abstraction, idealization, and novel explanation.",

Discussion of the observation of symmetries in nature is less common. This paper analyses the observation of particular symmetries such as Lorentz and gauge symmetries, distinguishing between direct observation of the symmetry itself and indirect evidence, the latter being the observation of some consequence of the symmetry. The result of the analysis is that global symmetries such as Lorentz symmetry are, in an important sense, directly observed, while local symmetries such as gauge symmetry are not.",

      "abstractNote": "We interpret the concept of determinism for a classical system as the requirement that the solution to the Cauchy problem for the equations of motion governing this system be unique. This requirement is generally believed to hold for all autonomous classical systems. Our analysis of classical electrodynamics in a world with one temporal and one spatial dimension provides counterexamples of this belief. Given the initial conditions of a particular type, the Cauchy problem may have an infinite set of solutions. Therefore, random behavior of closed classical systems is indeed possible. With this finding, we give a qualitative explanation of how classical strings can split. We propose a modified path integral formulation of classical mechanics to include indeterministic systems. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

Unlike some other putative cases of condensed matter emergence (such as thermal phase transitions), the FQH effect is not based on symmetry breaking. Instead FQH states are part of a distinct class of ordered matter that is defined topologically. Topologically ordered states result from complex long-ranged correlations between their constituent parts, such that the system displays strongly irreducible, qualitatively novel properties.",

Using this formalism, we relate the operator approach of Messiah and Greenberg (1964) to the configuration space approach pioneered by Souriau (1967), Laidlaw and DeWitt-Morette (1971), Leinaas and Myrheim (1977), and others. In dimension d>2d>2<math display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" altimg=\"eq-00002.gif\"><mi>d</mi><mo class=\"MathClass-rel\">&gt;</mo><mn>2</mn></math>, the former yields bosons, fermions, and paraparticles, whereas the latter seems to leave room for bosons and fermions only, apparently contradicting the operator approach as far as the admissibility of parastatistics is concerned. To resolve this, we first prove that in d>2d>2<math display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" altimg=\"eq-00003.gif\"><mi>d</mi><mo class=\"MathClass-rel\">&gt;</mo><mn>2</mn></math> the topologically non-trivial configuration spaces of the second approach are quantized by the algebras of observables of the first. Secondly, we show that the irreducible representations of the latter may be realized by vector bundle constructions, among which the line bundles recover the results of the second approach. Mathematically speaking, representations on higher-dimensional bundles (which define parastatistics) cannot be excluded, which render the configuration space approach incomplete. Physically, however, we show that the corresponding particle states may always be realized in terms of bosons and/or fermions with an unobserved internal degree of freedom (although based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this conclusion is analogous to the rigorous results of the Doplicher–Haag–Roberts analysis in algebraic quantum field theory, as well as to the heuristic arguments which led Gell-Mann and others to qcd (i.e. Quantum Chromodynamics)).",

I then propose a specific modification in the absence of gravitational interaction.

It is shown that on a continuous interval of its spectrum every Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space of one degree of freedom is a generalized coordinate with a conjugate generalized momentum. Every continuous spectral interval of a Hermitian operator is the limit of a discrete spectrum in the same interval. This result is applied to description of the state of a system by a statistical operator p($$\\hat q$$) following measurement of the probabilities of the eigenvalues of an observable$$\\hat q$$. Each continuous interval in the spectrum of$$\\hat q$$is replaced by a discrete spectrum in the same interval with a parameterK; the limitK → ∞ in which the spectrum becomes continuous is not attainable physically. In the linear vector space of a quantum mechanical system every continuous interval in the spectra of the observables is similarly replaced by a discrete spectrum with a finite parameter: it is a space of discrete bases and a set of such parameters. The case of degenerate spectrum is also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Alcohol and its effects on aggression have been the subject of many discussions and research papers. Despite this fact, there is still a debate surrounding what it is exactly about alcohol that causes aggression. The current study sought to replicate the past finding by Bartholow & Heinz (2006), that alcohol cues without consumption increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts, which can then influence aggressive behaviors. In the present study, participants had to complete a lexical decision task that was set up to assess whether aggressive words were detected faster in the presence of alcohol-related pictures compared to neutral pictures. The results of this study did not replicate the expected finding as only a main effect of word type was found in which participants detected neutral words faster than aggressive words. Furthermore, the study aimed to assess the role of gender stereotype acceptance levels in this association, but due to faulty design considerations, such analyses were not possible. The results are discussed in terms of the limitations of the study, and propositions for future directions are addressed.",

      "abstractNote": "The classical configuration space of a system of identical particles is examined. Due to the identification of points which are related by permutations of particle indices, it is essentially different, globally, from the Cartesian product of the one-particle spaces. This fact is explicity taken into account in a quantization of the theory. As a consequence, no symmetry constraints on the wave functions and the observables need to be postulated. The two possibilities, corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions, appear in a natural way in the formalism. But this is only the case in which the particles move in three- or higher-dimensional space. In one and two dimensions a continuum of possible intermediate cases connects the boson and fermion cases. The effect of particle spin in the present formalism is discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "This article is a short version of a longer article to appear in Physics Reports (cond-mat/9708200). The essential postulates of classical thermodynamics are formulated, from which the second law is deduced as the principle of increase of entropy in irreversible adiabatic processes that take one equilibrium state to another. The entropy constructed here is defined only for equilibrium states and no attempt is made to define it otherwise. Statistical mechanics does not enter these considerations. One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that any two states of the same chemical composition can be connected by an adiabatic process) and we show that it can be derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed. Our formulation offers a certain clarity and rigor that goes beyond most textbook discussions of the second law.",

      "abstractNote": "There has been much discussion of the indispensability argument for the existence of mathematical objects. In this paper I reconsider the debate by using the notion of grounding, or non-causal dependence. First of all, I investigate what proponents of the indispensability argument should say about the grounding of relations between physical objects and mathematical ones. This reveals some resources which nominalists are entitled to use. Making use of these resources, I present a neglected but promising response to the indispensability argument—a liberalized version of Field’s response—and I discuss its significance. I argue that if it succeeds, it provides a new refutation of the indispensability argument; and that, even if it fails, its failure may bolster some of the fictionalist responses to the indispensability argument already under discussion. In addition, I use grounding to reply to a recent challenge to these responses.",

This paper produces a more Aristotelian theory, eschewing the existence of points and the use of infinite sets or pluralities. We first show how to modify the original theory. There are a number of theorems (such as the existence of bisections) that have to be added as axioms. Building on some work by Linnebo, we then show how to take the 'potential' nature of the usual operations seriously, by using a modal language, and we show that the two approaches are equivalent.",

We then argue that the method of infinite idealization is widely used in the practice of science, and not all uses of the method are the same (or evoke the same philosophical problems). We then confront the compatibility problem of infinite idealization with scientific realism. We propose and defend a contextualist position for (local) realism and argue that the cases for infinite idealization appear to be fully compatible with contextual realism.",

And it is widely considered to be undeniably true-in much the same way that arithmetic seems to be undeniably true. However, over the years, various philosophers, mathematicians, statisticians, and scientists have found potential faults with Kolmogorov's axiom system. In this chapter these potential faults are reviewed and discussed. Among them are the problematic countable additivity, as well as finite additivity. The chapter also includes critical examinations of conditional probability, positive real numbers and sets and algebras as deployed by Kolmogorov. Keywords: probability, axiom system, Kolmogorov, countable additivity finite additivity \"[… T]here is little disagreement about the truth of the theory-indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the theory of probability is commonly regarded as though it were necessarily true.\" Humphreys (1985), p. 568.",

      "abstractNote": "This thesis gives a philosophical assessment of a contemporary movement, influential amongst physicists, about the status of microscopic and macroscopic properties. The fountainhead for the movement was a short 1972 paper `More is Different', written by the condensed-matter physicist, Philip Anderson. Each of the chapters is concerned with themes mentioned in that paper, or subsequently expounded by Anderson and his followers. In Chapter 1, I aim to locate Anderson's existence claims for `emergent properties' within the metaphysical, epistemological and methodological doctrines that identify themselves as `emergentist'. I argue, against the commentators' consensus, that the New Emergentists make claims about the metaphysical status of physical properties, and should not be read as concerned only with matters of research methodology for physics. In Chapter 2, I look at the physical examples that the New Emergentists appeal to, and propose a way of formulating their main claims within modern analytic metaphysics. I argue that it is possible to view their thesis as an updated version of `British Emergentism' a movement popular in the early years of the twentieth century. I support this contention by comparing examples of emergent properties put forward by the British and the New Emergentists. Chapter 3 is a discussion of the significance of renormalisation techniques. I attack a set of claims by Robert Batterman, who presents renormalisation as an explanatory strategy unrecognised by the philosophy of science. I separate several different methods of renormalisation analysis, and argue that he has conflated them. In Chapter 4, I discuss the theoretical representation of phase transitions in condensed matter physics; in particular, their appeal to the limit of an infinite system. I examine and refute various claims to the effect that the ineliminability of this limit in modelling phase transitions is of great metaphysical significance. I suggest a definition of phase transitions for finite systems that dissolves this illusion, and gives us reason to trust the results of the theories that only apply in the infinite limit. %I then comment on the significance of these results for a suggestion of Laura Ruetsche, that quantum statistical mechanics should be used as a guide to the interpretation of quantum field theory. Chapter 5 revisits the doctrines of the New Emergentists in order to place their views within some wider philosophical debates. I look at how their doctrines bear on issues in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of science. I close by returning to the context within physics, in which the New Emergentists originally made their presence felt: the controversy over whether elementary particle physics should enjoy greater status than other areas.",

      "abstractNote": "Thermodynamics is the paradigm example in physics of a time-asymmetric theory, but the origin of the asymmetry lies deeper than the second law. A primordial arrow can be defined by the way of the equilibration principle (“minus first law”). By appealing to this arrow, the nature of the well-known ambiguity in Carathéodory's 1909 version of the second law becomes clear. Following Carathéodory's seminal work, formulations of thermodynamics have gained ground that highlight the role of the binary relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states, the most prominent recent example being the important 1999 axiomatization due to Lieb and Yngvason. This formulation can be shown to contain an ambiguity strictly analogous to that in Carathéodory's treatment.",

THE is found to be a promising tool for probing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and consequent magnetic skyrmions. This interaction arises from broken inversion symmetry and hence can be artificially introduced at interface; this concept is lately verified in metal multilayers. However, there are few attempts to investigate such DM interaction at interface through electron transport. We clarified how the transport properties couple with interface DM interaction by fabricating the epitaxial oxide interface. We observed THE in epitaxial bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and paramagnetic SrIrO3 over a wide region of both temperature and magnetic field. The magnitude of THE rapidly decreases with the thickness of SrRuO3, suggesting that the interface DM interaction plays a significant role. Such interaction is expected to realize a 10-nm-sized Néel-type magnetic skyrmion. The present results established that the high-quality oxide interface enables us to tune the effective DM interaction; this can be a step toward future topological electronics. Electronic transport measurements reveal the formation of swirling spin textures, skyrmions, at high-quality oxide interface. Electronic transport measurements reveal the formation of swirling spin textures, skyrmions, at high-quality oxide interface.",

One sort of solution recommends extending the number field used to represent credences and chance to the surreals or hyperreals. But the correct solution—the solution that always respects the Euclidean property—is to eliminate numbers from the fundamental representation of credence and chance altogether in favor of a system of relations. This solution also sheds light on other paradoxes, such as the Banach-Tarski paradox and the St. Petersburg paradox.",

The classical discreteness of spectrum criterion by A. M. Molchanov (1953) uses a notion of negligible set in a cube as a set whose Wiener capacity is less than a small constant times the capacity of the cube. We prove that this constant can be taken arbitrarily between 0 and 1. This solves a problem formulated by I. M. Gelfand in 1953. Moreover, we extend the notion of negligibility by allowing the constant to depend on the size of the cube. We give a complete description of all negligibility conditions of this kind. The a priori equivalence of our conditions involving different negligibility classes is a nontrivial property of the capacity. We also establish similar strict positivity criteria for the Schrödinger operators with nonnegative potentials.",

      "abstractNote": "Phase transitions are an important instance of putatively emergent behavior. Unlike many things claimed emergent by philosophers (e.g., tables and chairs), the alleged emergence of phase transitions stems from both philosophical and scientific arguments. Here we focus on the case for emergence built from physics, in particular, arguments based upon the infinite idealization invoked in the statistical mechanical treatment of phase transitions. After teasing apart several challenges, we defend the idea that phase transitions are best thought of as conceptually novel, but not ontologically or explanatorily irreducible to finite physics; indeed, by looking at ongoing work on “smooth phase transitions” we even suggest that they’re not even conceptually novel. In the case of renormalization group theory, consideration of infinite systems and their singular behavior provides a central theoretical tool, but this is compatible with an explanatory reduction. Phase transitions may be “emergent” in some sense of this protean term, but not in a sense that is incompatible with the reductionist project broadly construed.",

Additionally, the explanation of the universal behavior of systems near their critical point seems to require the infinite idealization\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=9\">Menon,Callender 2011:9</a>) \n\n\"The concept of \"emergence\" is notoriously slippery, interpreted differently by different authors.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=9\">Menon,Callender 2011:9</a>) \n\n\"This conception is deliberately vague, allowing for various precisifications depending on one's theory of explanation\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=9\">Menon,Callender 2011:9</a>) \n\n\"Often, the reductionist may be able to avoid a counterexample by 1 simply re-conceiving what counts as an adequate explanation. However, certain instances will be regarded as explanatory failures under a wide variety of plausible accounts of explanation, perhaps even under al l plausible accounts of explanation.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=10\">Menon,Callender 2011:10</a>) \n\n\"For instance, from the perspective of statistical mechanics, the transition from ice to water in a finite system as we cross 273.16 K is not qualitatively different from the transition from cold ice to slightly warmer ice as we cross 260 K, at least if something like the standard story is correct. The only difference is that the thermodynamic potentials change a lot more rapidly in the former situation than in the latter, but they are still analytic, so this is merely a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=10\">Menon,Callender 2011:10</a>) \n\n\"However, one might want to resist this eliminativism and reject the notion that thermodynamics has misclassified phenomena.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=11\">Menon,Callender 2011:11</a>) \n\n\"Even though statistical mechanics does not group phase transitions together the way that thermodynamics does, it is still able to fully explain what goes on in individual instances of phase transition. Perhaps the existence of individual explanations in every case constitutes an adequate explanation of the nomic pattern described by thermodynamics.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=11\">Menon,Callender 2011:11</a>) \n\n\"If we cannot give such an explanation, we have another potential variety of emergence: explanatory irreducibility.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=12\">Menon,Callender 2011:12</a>) \n\n\"We have found that when one clarifies concepts and digs into the details, with respect to standard textbook statistical mechanics, phase transitions are best thought of as conceptually novel, but not ontologically or explanatorily irreducible. And if one goes past textbook statistical mechanics, then an argument can be made that they're not even conceptually novel.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N697J8N?page=34\">Menon,Callender 2011:34</a>)",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper I shall adopt a possible reading of the notions of ‘explanatory indispensability’ and ‘genuine mathematical explanation in science’ on which the Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA) proposed by Alan Baker is based. Furthermore, I shall propose two examples of mathematical explanation in science and I shall show that, whether the EIA-partisans accept the reading I suggest, they are easily caught in a dilemma. To escape this dilemma they need to adopt some account of explanation and offer a plausible answer to the following ‘question of evidence’: What is a genuine mathematical explanation in empirical science and on what basis do we consider it as such? Finally, I shall suggest how a possible answer to the question of evidence might be given through a specific account of mathematical explanation in science. Nevertheless, the price of adopting this standpoint is that the genuineness of mathematical explanations of scientific facts turns out to be dependent on pragmatic constraints and therefore cannot be plugged in EIA and used to establish existential claims about mathematical objects.",

      "abstractNote": "Our object in this paper is to study the antecedents, contents, implications, and impact of a not well-known or appreciated paper by EHRENFEST in 1911 on the essential nature of the different quantum hypotheses in radiation theory. After a careful analysis of EHRENFEST’s notebooks, correspondence, and publications, we conclude that the essential points of EHRENFEST’s paper were not perceived to a large extent, and hence that its implications were not considered thoroughly. Specifically, we show that EHRENFEST contributed significantly to the clarifications of the differences between PLANCK’s and EINSTEIN’s respective quantum hypotheses, as well as to those of the concepts ‘‘discontinuity,’’ ‘‘quantization,’’ and ‘‘corpuscularity.’’",

In addition to consideringthe selective publication of results, I argue that we need to also consider the selective publicationof epistemic by-products—observations and knowledge that scientists accumulate incidentallyin the process of carrying out their work. There are three reasons why we should be concernedabout the exclusion of epistemic by-products from the published literature: first, because theyplay an important role in robust replication attempts; second, because their absence can resultin misplaced scientific certainty; and third, because they contribute to a holistic understandingof natural phenomena. However, identifying and addressing publication bias against epistemicby-products and other undervalued forms of knowledge is more difficult than identifying biasagainst quantitative findings. I argue that scientific pluralism and making data publicly accessibleare two potential remedies for addressing this form of publication bias.",

      "abstractNote": "According to Quine’s indispensability argument, we ought to believe in just those mathematical entities that we quantify over in our best scientific theories. Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment is part of the standard indispensability argument. However, we suggest that a new indispensability argument can be run using Armstrong’s criterion of ontological commitment rather than Quine’s. According to Armstrong’s criterion, ‘to be is to be a truthmaker (or part of one)’. We supplement this criterion with our own brand of metaphysics, 'Aristotelian realism', in order to identify the truthmakers of mathematics. We consider in particular as a case study the indispensability to physics of real analysis (the theory of the real numbers). We conclude that it is possible to run an indispensability argument without Quinean baggage.",

The saga of quantum discontinuity illustrates the power of evidence to determine theory and shows how that power can be underestimated by inadequate caricatures of the evidential case. That quantum discontinuity can save the phenomena of black body radiation is the widely known result, but it leaves open the possibilities of other accounts. That these phenomena, with the aid of minimal assumptions, entail quantum discontinuity is the crucial but now largely forgotten result. It was first demonstrated by Ehrenfest and Poincaré in 1911 and 1912.",

          "note": "<h1>Annotations\n (4/14/2022, 12:15:52 PM)</h1> \n\n“I will propose a use of the terms that roughly reflects common usage: approximations merely describe a target system inexactly. They are propositional. Idealizations refer to new systems, some of whose properties approximate some of those of the target system.” (Norton, 2012, p. 207) This is basically the central claim. \n\n“these “limit properties,” as I shall call them, provide approximations” (Norton, 2012, p. 208) \n\n“We may also posit an infinity of components and examine the resulting system’s properties. These “limit systems” are idealizations.” (Norton, 2012, p. 208) \n\n“2. Approximation and Idealization Distinguished.” (Norton, 2012, p. 208) # \n\n“An approximation is an inexact description of a target system. It is propositional. An idealization is a real or fictitious system, distinct from the target system, some of whose properties provide an inexact description of some aspects of the target system.” (Norton, 2012, p. 209) While Norton presents this as a somewhat clear distinction, I don't think it  works very well as a way to determine which things are idealizations or approximations. \n\n“2.3. Promotion and Demotion.” (Norton, 2012, p. 211) ## \n\n“Approximations and idealizations are interrelated in a way illustrated by these last two examples: An idealization can be demoted to an approximation by discarding the idealizing system and merely extracting the inexact description; however, the inverse promotion to an idealizing system will not always succeed. In the inverse promotion, we consider the target system to be one of a sequence of systems whose limit system is intended to be the idealizing system. The promotion fails if the sequence fails to have a limit system or has a limit system with unsuitable properties.” (Norton, 2012, p. 211) \n\n“3. The Problem of Limits.” (Norton, 2012, p. 212) # \n\n“3.1. Limit Property and Limit System Agree.” (Norton, 2012, p. 212) ## \n\n“The example implements the general scheme in which we have the sequences: System1, System2, System3, . . . , Limit System agrees with Property1, Property2, Property3, . . . , Limit Property.” (Norton, 2012, p. 212) \n\n“3.2. There Is No Limit System.” (Norton, 2012, p. 213) ## \n\n“This example implements the scheme System1, System2, System3, . . . (No Limit) Property1, Property2, Property3, . . . Limit Property.” (Norton, 2012, p. 213) \n\n“3.3. Limit Property and Limit System Disagree.” (Norton, 2012, p. 213) ## \n\n“The example implements the general scheme in which we have the sequences: System1, System2, System3, . . . Limit System disagrees with Property1, Property2, Property3, . . . Limit Property,” (Norton, 2012, p. 214) \n\n“4. The Limits of Statistical Mechanics.” (Norton, 2012, p. 214) # \n\n“Much of the thermodynamic formalism is concerned with the study of states of infinite systems.” What makes the transition to an infinity of components admissible is the assumption that the infinite systems will provide a good description of large but finite systems.” (Norton, 2012, p. 215) i.e. that they are approxmations \n\n“for a survey, see Laraudogoitia (2011).” (Norton, 2012, p. 215) todo check out survey on supertasks \n\n“All the finite systems have the properties of determinism and energy conservation; hence, the limit properties are determinism and conservation. The infinite limit system, however, is indeterministic and nonconservative.” (Norton, 2012, p. 216) How do you pick which properties to focus on to be pathological? \n\n“4.2.1. The Continuum Limit.” (Norton, 2012, p. 217) ## \n\n“In the continuum limit described by Compagner (1989), the number of components n goes to infinity in such a way that the extensive magnitudes of the system, such as volume and energy, remain constant. If d is a parameter that measures the size of the individual components, this condition entails that nd 3 remains a nonzero constant, for nd 3 is proportional to the volume of the system occupied by matter. Similarly, Boltzmann’s constant k goes to zero since nk remains a nonzero constant. For the mean energy of a mole of a monatomic gas, n p N,is given by , and this remains constant in the limit” (Norton, 2012, p. 217) Similar to half-tone printing: a lot of points will either have black, white, or no determinate state as a limit state when subdividing an array of squares with every step. In other words,smaller and smaller things -&gt; infinite amounts of small things, not to a continuum \n\n“4.3. Renormalization Group Methods Are Approximations Not Idealizations.” (Norton, 2012, p. 219) ## \n\n“Some authors, such as Lanford and Ruelle, invoke the strong form” (Norton, 2012, p. 219) \n\n“of the thermodynamic limit and investigate the properties of infinite systems. Others use what I shall call a “weak” form of the thermodynamic limit that mentions only the existence of limit properties.” (Norton, 2012, p. 220) + \n\n“Kadanoff (2000, 239) reviews the governing fact that a partition function of a system of finitely many components is analytic. It becomes nonanalytic only in the limit of infinitely many components, whereupon the thermodynamic quantities derived from it can harbor discontinuities that characterize critical points. He continues: “We reach the important conclusion: The existence of a phase transition requires an infinite system. No phase transitions occur in systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom.”” (Norton, 2012, p. 220) \n\n“Insofar as they yield results, we shall see the limit taken by renormalization group methods is of the properties only, such as in the weak thermodynamic limit of Le Bellac et al.” (Norton, 2012, p. 220) Interesting claim. \n\n“5. Phase Transitions and Finite Systems.” (Norton, 2012, p. 223) # \n\n“My concern here is one argument used to support the antireduction view. It asserts, contrary to the analysis of the last section, that renormalization group methods do employ infinite idealizations, that these infinite idealizations somehow outstrip the reductive powers of statistical mechanics and, moreover, that they are ineliminable.” (Norton, 2012, p. 223) @Norton2012 disagrees with @Butterfield2020 on whether renormalization group methods are infinite idealiations. \n\n“For an entry into this literature, see Liu (1999), Callender (2001), Batterman (2002, 2005, 2010, 2011), Belot (2005), Jones (2006), Butterfield (2011a, 2011b), Butterfield and Bouatta (2011), and Menon and Callender (2011).” (Norton, 2012, p. 223) Minor literature overview for reduction/emergence statistical mechanics. \n\n“Through an analogous infinite limit, we can recover nonanalytic functions from the functions governing arbitrarily large systems of finitely many components. These nonanalytic functions and their discontinuities have a pragmatic value only. If the atomic theory of matter is true, then ordinary thermal systems of finitely many components cannot display discontinuous changes in their thermodynamic properties. The changes they manifest are merely so rapid as to be observationally indistinguishable from discontinuous behavior.13 Indeed, if we could establish that the phase transitions of real substances exhibit these discontinuities, we would have refuted the atomic theory of matter, which holds that ordinary thermal systems are composed of finitely many atoms, molecules, or components. It must be feared that a similar refutation is at hand, if the positing of infinitely many components is necessary to recover other observed behaviors of phase transitions.” (Norton, 2012, p. 225) Basically @Callendar2001: discontinuities in the phase transition functions are at odds with the atomic theory of matter. Although: we do not believe in the atomic theory of matter to begin with, I think that most physicists when pressed would agree that QFT is a more precise representation of our world. \n\n“In the case of phase transitions, at best, we do not know whether the limit system and limit properties agree. For, in general, we do not know whether the systems to which the infinite component Hamiltonians are attached carry the limit properties of those with finite component Hamiltonians. Investigating this agreement is not a standard part of a renormalization group analysis. We have some reason to expect the agreement to fail. In a few cases that have been worked out, such as those mentioned in section 4.1, it does fail. Extra conditions, peculiar to the infinite case, are needed to enforce specifically identified finite behaviors such as determinism. With this uncertainty, prudence indicates that we should dispense with the idealization, for the approximation already tells us what we could learn from the idealization about the target system. Persisting with the idealization merely risks the error of attributing properties to the limit system that it does not bear. In short, the renormalization group analysis of phase transitions is a case in which all benefits are already accrued by the approximation. Promoting it to an idealization merely risks erroneous attributions for no gain.” (Norton, 2012, p. 226) Basically: \"if we can make due with the approximations then don't idealize them dummy.\" I know that this is not a popular view wrt renormalization group. \n\n“The physics of phase transitions is complicated and difficult, and its philosophical analysis is rewarding. However, once one sees past the traps of the infinite limits, it is hard to find philosophical discontinuities.” (Norton, 2012, p. 227) Mwah, not really sure I agree here. Why though? \n\n“Finally, the idea that discontinuous changes of phase transitions are emergent phenomena is difficult to penetrate, for the phenomena at issue are not possible objects of experience. Real phase transitions cannot exhibit the discontinuities on pain of contradicting the atomic theory of matter, and, were the discontinuities established factually, the atomic theory would fall.” (Norton, 2012, p. 228) This is precisely what @Shech2019 argues against, because you cannot say it contradicts unless you have some argument that they are claimed to be real.",

      "abstractNote": "1. Approximations of arbitrarily large but finite systems are often mistaken for infinite idealizations in statistical and thermal physics. The problem is illustrated by thermodynamically reversible processes. They are approximations of processes requiring arbitrarily long, but finite times to complete, not processes requiring an actual infinity of time. 2. The present debate over whether phase transitions comprise a failure of reduction is confounded by a confusion of two senses of \" level \" : the molecular versus the thermodynamic level and the few component versus the many component level.",

      "abstractNote": "The indispensability argument (IA) comes in many different versions that all reduce to a general valid schema. Providing a sound IA amounts to providing a full interpretation of the schema according to which all its premises are true. Hence, arguing whether IA is sound results in wondering whether the schema admits such an interpretation. We discuss in full details all the parameters on which the specification of the general schema may depend. In doing this, we consider how different versions of IA can be obtained, also through different specifications of the notion of indispensability. We then distinguish between schematic and genuine IA, and argue that no genuine (non-vacuously and non-circularly) sound IA is available or easily forthcoming. We then submit that this holds also in the particularly relevant case in which indispensability is conceived as explanatory indispensability.",

      "abstractNote": "The author of “Parsimony and inference to the best mathematical explanation” argues for platonism by way of an enhanced indispensability argument based on an inference to yet better mathematical optimization explanations in the natural sciences. Since such explanations yield beneficial trade-offs between stronger mathematical existential claims and fewer concrete ontological commitments than those involved in (as it were) merely good mathematical explanations, one must countenance the mathematical objects that play a theoretical role in them via an application of the relevant mathematical results. The nominalist’s challenge is thus to undermine the platonistic force of such explanations by way of alternative nominalistic ones. The author’s contention is that such nominalistic explanations should provide a paraphrase of the proofs of the mathematical results being applied. There are reasons to doubt that proofs, construed here as formal derivations, actually contribute to the platonistc force to be undermined and, by parity, that nominalized proofs should bear responsability for the corresponding undermining. A discussion of two examples (Baker’s magicicadas, the hexagonal shape of honeycombs) and of associated arguments by Lange, Pincock, Steiner and Tallant, point to a a wealth of worries concerning the construal of this explanatory role. Among those figure the distinction between the weak and strong role of proofs, the distinction between causal or “ordinary” explanations and genuine mathematical ones, and the unifying role of optimization explanations. More generally, the very idea that the explanatory advantages yielded by applied mathematical claims may be construed as gradual or progressive and the associated notion that the feasibility of their nominalistic paraphrases decreases as the generality and force of these claim increases, deserves a closer attention.",

      "abstractNote": "Several rare-earth monopnictides were shown to exhibit extreme magnetoresistance and field-induced low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity. These features are also hallmarks of topological semimetals, thus the family is intensively explored with respect to magneto-transport properties and possible hosting Dirac fermion states. We report a comprehensive investigation of Fermi surface and electrical transport properties of LuSb, another representative of this family. At low temperatures, the magnetoresistance of LuSb was found to exceed 3000% without saturation in fields up to 9 T. Analysis of the Hall effect and the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations revealed that the Fermi surface of this compound consists of several pockets originating from fairly compensated multi-band electronic structure, in full accordance with our first-principles calculations. Observed magnetotransport properties of LuSb can be attributed to the topology of three-dimensional Fermi surface and a compensation of electron and hole contributions.",

      "abstractNote": "An innovative, multifaceted approach to scientific experiments as designed by and shaped through interaction with the modeling process The role of scientific modeling in mediation between theories and phenomena is a critical topic within the philosophy of science, touching on issues from climate modeling to synthetic models in biology, high energy particle physics, and cognitive sciences. Offering a radically new conception of the role of data in the scientific modeling process as well as a new awareness of the problematic aspects of data, this cutting-edge volume offers a multifaceted view on experiments as designed and shaped in interaction with the modeling process. Contributors address such issues as the construction of models in conjunction with scientific experimentation; the status of measurement and the function of experiment in the identification of relevant parameters; how the phenomena under study are reconceived when accounted for by a model; and the interplay between experimenting, modeling, and simulation when results do not mesh. Highlighting the mediating role of models and the model-dependence (as well as theory-dependence) of data measurement, this volume proposes a normative and conceptual innovation in scientific modeling–that the phenomena to be investigated and modeled must not be precisely identified at the start but specified during the course of the interactions arising between experimental and modeling activities.

      "abstractNote": "Idealized scientific representations result from employing claims that we take to be false. It is not surprising, then, that idealizations are a prime example of allegedly inconsistent scientific representations. I argue that the claim that an idealization requires inconsistent beliefs is often incorrect and that it turns out that a more mathematical perspective allows us to understand how the idealization can be interpreted consistently. The main example discussed is the claim that models of ocean waves typically involve the false assumption that the ocean is infinitely deep. While it is true that the variable associated with depth is often taken to infinity in the representation of ocean waves, I explain how this mathematical transformation of the original equations does not require the belief that the ocean being modeled is infinitely deep. More generally, as a mathematical representation is manipulated, some of its components are decoupled from their original physical interpretation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

I will begin by considering the strategy that puts grounding to the service of easy-road nominalists (“Nominalistic content meets grounding” section). I will give some support to this strategy by addressing a worry some may have about it (“A misguided worry about the grounding strategy” section). I will then consider a problem for the fast-lane strategy (“Grounding and generality: a problem for the fast lane” section) and a problem for easy-road nominalists willing to accept Liggins’ grounding strategy (“More on the grounding strategy and easy-road nominalism” section). Both are related to the problem of formulating nominalistic explanations at the right level of generality. I will then consider a problem that Liggins only hints at (“Mathematics and covering generalizations” section). This problem has to do with mathematics’ function of providing the sort of covering generalizations we need in scientific explanations.",

      "abstractNote": "The search for the statistical mechanical underpinning of thermodynamic irreversibility has so far focussed on the spontaneous approach to equilibrium. But this is the search for the underpinning of what Brown and Uffink (2001) have dubbed the ‘minus first law’ of thermodynamics. In contrast, the second law tells us that certain interventions on equilibrium states render the initial state ‘irrecoverable’. In this paper, I discuss the unusual nature of processes in thermodynamics, and the type of irreversibility that the second law embodies. I then search for the microscopic underpinning or statistical mechanical ‘reductive basis’ of the second law of thermodynamics by taking a functionalist strategy. First, I outline the functional role of the thermodynamic entropy: for a thermally isolated system, the thermodynamic entropy is constant in quasi-static processes, but increasing in non-quasi-static processes. I then search for the statistical mechanical quantity that plays this role — rather than the role of the traditional ‘holy grail’ as described by Callender (1999). I argue that in statistical mechanics, the Gibbs entropy plays this role.",

Anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect are an example for exchange statistics intermediate between bosons and fermions. We analyze a mesoscopic setup in which two dilute beams of anyons collide with each other, and relate the correlations of current fluctuations to the probability of particles excluding each other spatially. While current correlations for fermions vanish, negative correlations for anyons are a clear signature of a reduced spatial exclusion as compared to fermions.",

      "abstractNote": "Reissued in the Cambridge Mathematical Library this classic book outlines the theory of thermodynamic formalism which was developed to describe the properties of certain physical systems consisting of a large number of subunits. It is aimed at mathematicians interested in ergodic theory, topological dynamics, constructive quantum field theory, the study of certain differentiable dynamical systems, notably Anosov diffeomorphisms and flows. It is also of interest to theoretical physicists concerned with the conceptual basis of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The level of the presentation is generally advanced, the objective being to provide an efficient research tool and a text for use in graduate teaching. Background material on mathematics has been collected in appendices to help the reader. Extra material is given in the form of updates of problems that were open at the original time of writing and as a new preface specially written for this new edition by the author.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditionally, philosophers of quantum mechanics have addressed exceedingly simple systems: a pair of electrons in an entangled state, or an atom and a cat in Dr. Schrodinger's diabolical device. But recently, much more complicated systems, such as quantum fields and the infinite systems at the thermodynamic limit of quantum statistical mechanics, have attracted, and repaid, philosophical attention. Interpreting Quantum Theories has three entangled aims. The first is to guide those familiar with the philosophy of ordinary QM into the philosophy of 'QM infinity', by presenting accessible introductions to relevant technical notions and the foundational questions they frame. The second aim is to develop and defend answers to some of those questions. Does quantum field theory demand or deserve a particle ontology? How (if at all) are different states of broken symmetry different? And what is the proper role of idealizations in working physics? The third aim is to highlight ties between the foundational investigation of QM infinity and philosophy more broadly construed, in particular by using the interpretive problems discussed to motivate new ways to think about the nature of physical possibility and the problem of scientific realism.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper addresses the doubts voiced by Wigner about the physical relevance of the concept of geometrical points by exploiting some facts known to all but honored by none: Almost all real numbers are transcendental; the explicit representation of any one will require an infinite amount of physical resources. An instrument devised to measure a continuous real variable will need a continuum of internal states to achieve perfect resolution. Consequently, a laboratory instrument for measuring a continuous variable in a finite time can report only a finite number of values, each of which is constrained to be a rational number. It does not matter whether the variable is classical or quantum-mechanical. Now, in von Neumann’s measurement theory (von Neumann, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Princeton University Press, Princeton, [1955]), an operator A with a continuous spectrum—which has no eigenvectors—cannot be measured, but it can be approximated by operators with discrete spectra which are measurable. The measurable approximant F(A) is not canonically determined; it has to be chosen by the experimentalist. It is argued that this operator can always be chosen in such a way that Sewell’s results (Sewell in Rep. Math. Phys. 56: 271, [2005]; Sewell, Lecture given at the J.T. Lewis Memorial Conference, Dublin, [2005]) on the measurement of a hermitian operator on a finite-dimensional vector space (described in Sect. 3.2) constitute an adequate resolution of the measurement problem in this theory. From this follows our major conclusion, which is that the notion of a geometrical point is as meaningful in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as it is in classical physics. It is necessary to be sensitive to the fact that there is a gap between theoretical and experimental physics, which reveals itself tellingly as an error inherent in the measurement of a continuous variable.",

Bertrand advances a probability problem, now known as his paradox, to which the principle is supposed to apply; yet, just because the problem is ill-posed in a technical sense, applying it leads to a contradiction. Examining an ambiguity in the notion of an ill-posed problem shows that there are precisely two strategies for resolving the paradox: the distinction strategy and the well-posing strategy. The main contenders for resolving the paradox, Marinoff and Jaynes, offer solutions which exemplify these two strategies. I show that Marinoff's attempt at the distinction strategy fails, and I offer a general refutation of this strategy. The situation for the well-posing strategy is more complex. Careful formulation of the paradox within measure theory shows that one of Bertrand's original three options can be ruled out but also shows that piecemeal attempts at the well-posing strategy will not succeed. What is required is an appeal to general principle. I show that Jaynes's use of such a principle, the symmetry requirement, fails to resolve the paradox; that a notion of metaindifference also fails; and that, while the well-posing strategy may not be conclusively refutable, there is no reason to think that it can succeed. So the current situation is this. The failure of Marinoff's and Jaynes's solutions means that the paradox remains unresolved, and of the only two strategies for resolution, one is refuted and we have no reason to think the other will succeed. Consequently, Bertrand's paradox continues to stand in refutation of the principle of indifference.",

No phase transitions occur in systems with afinite number of degrees of freedom\"\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=1\">Shech 2013:1170</a>) \n\n\"PT do and do not occur infinite, and thus concrete and physical, systems.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=2\">Shech 2013:1171</a>) \n\n\"In other words, it really must be the case that a phase transition \"is emergent precisely because it is a property offinite systems and yet only reducible to ðLiu S104Þ micro-properties of infinite systems\" 1999, or, more recently, that \"the phenomenon of a phase transition, as described by classic thermodynamics cannot be derived unless one assumes that the system under study ðBangu 488Þ. is infinite\" 2009,\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=2\">Shech 2013:1171</a>) \n\n\"My negative thesis is that there really is no paradox of phase transitions and that in order to get a bonafide paradox, that is, a contradiction, one must undertake substantial philosophical work and ground a type of indispensability argument\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=2\">Shech 2013:1171</a>) \n\n\"I claim that the entirety of the debate, insofar as it is grounded in the paradox of PT, is misguided and that the philosophical import that has been extracted from the case study of PT with regard to emergence, reduction, explanation, and so on is not warranted\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=2\">Shech 2013:1171</a>) \n\n\"ðEIÞ1— essential

(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=2\">Shech 2013:1171</a>) \n\n\"what is really interesting about phase transitions is the manner by which they illustrate the essential idealization ðEIPÞ, problem which is tightly connected to issues arising in the context of scientific representation and scientific realism.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=3\">Shech 2013:1172</a>) \n\n\"that concrete systems can and cannot undergo PT: 2\" (<a

href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=3\">Shech 2013:1172</a>) \n\n\"we mustfirst distinguish between concrete PT, on the one hand, and abstract mathematical representations of them, on the other hand. 4\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=3\">Shech 2013:1172</a>) \n\n\"ambiguities\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=4\">Shech 2013:1173</a>) \n\n\"To avoid confusion, note that by \"abstract PT\" I only mean PT in the sense that an abstract Z displays a discontinuity\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=4\">Shech 2013:1173</a>) \n\n\"Thus, for example, if \"PT\" and \"Z\" in tenets 3 and 4 refer to abstract mathematical representations, as opposed to concrete objects, then there is no paradox: concrete andfinite systems display PTwhile abstract andfinite ones do not.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=4\">Shech 2013:1173</a>) \n\n\"Rather, what follows is that concrete PT occur when abstract representations of them display various abstract properties, such as a discontinuity in Z and an appeal to the TDL\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=4\">Shech 2013:1173</a>) \n\n\"For my purposes, what is important is to identify that the large majority, if not all, of the phase transition debate arises from the phase transition paradox\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=5\">Shech 2013:1174</a>) \n\n\"While I take \"representation\" to be stipulated denotation,\"

get: concrete systems are and are not composed offinitely many particles N.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=6\">Shech 2013:1175</a>) \n\n\"The source of the problem of PT seems to be that the mathematical structure that scientifically represents concrete PT—a discontinuity in the partition function—is an artifact of an idealization\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=6\">Shech 2013:1175</a>) \n\n\"what is really interesting about PT is the manner by which they might shed light on the nature of scientific representation and idealization.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=6\">Shech 2013:1175</a>) \n\n\"But, when one adds the correspondence relation described by tenet 6, a bonafide paradox arises: concrete systems are and are not A\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LHWZUFBR?page=7\">Shech 2013:1176</a>) \n\n\"The question, of course, is why would one endorse tenet 6?

      "abstractNote": "This dissertation concerns the philosophical underpinnings of representation and idealization in science. I begin by looking at the philosophical debate revolving around phase transitions and use it as a foil to bring out what I take to be most interesting about phase transitions, namely, the manner by which they illustrate the problem of essential idealizations. I continue to solve the problem in several steps. First, I conduct an interdisciplinary comparative study of different types of representations (e.g., mental, linguistic, pictorial) and consequently promote a content-based account of scientific representation intended to accommodate the practice of idealization and misrepresentation. I then critically asses the literature on idealizations in science in order to identify the manner by which to justify appeals to idealizations in science, and implement such techniques in two case studies that merit special attention: the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the quantum Hall effects. I proceed to offer a characterization of essential idealizations meant to alleviate the woes associated with said problem, and argue that particular types of idealizations, dubbed pathological idealizations, ought to be dispensed with. My motto is that idealizations are essential to explanation and representation, as well as to methodology and pedagogy, but they essentially misrepresent. Implications for the debate on platonism about mathematical objects are outlined.",

It is argued that a common topological approach, which takes the non-simply connected electron configuration space to be an essential element in the explanation and understanding of the effect, is flawed. An alternative approach is outlined. Consequently, it is shown that the existence and uniqueness of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators in quantum mechanics have important implications for philosophical issues. Also, the alleged indispensable explanatory role of said idealizations is examined via a minimal model explanatory scheme. Last, the idealizations involved in the AB effect are placed in a wider philosophical context via a short survey of part of the literature on infinite and essential idealizations.",

Specifically, by appealing to John Norton’s distinction between idealization and approximation, I argue that the phenomena of fractional quantum statistics bears negatively on Mary Leng’s proposed path to easy road nominalism, thereby partially defending Mark Colyvan’s claim that there is no easy road to nominalism.",

          "note": "<h1>Annotations\n (4/15/2022, 6:28:31 PM)</h1> \n\n“1 Introduction” (Shech, 2019, p. 1963) ## \n\n“The overarching goal of this essay is to draw attention to some interesting connections between the literature on infinite and infinitesimal idealizations in science and issues in philosophy of mathematics such as mathematical indispensability and explanation” (Shech, 2019, p. 1963) \n\n“I first introduce Leng’s (2005, 2010, 2012) approach to easy road nominalism in Sect. 2 and show how it depends on the idea that a physical system can “approximately instantiate” mathematical structure where a mathematical explanation is at hand.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1965) \n\n“Since Leng (2005, 2010, 2012) does not does explicate what is meant by “approximate instantiation,” I critically consider a possible way of expounding on her account via Norton’s (2012) well-received distinction between approximations and idealizations in Sect. 3: physical structure can approximately instantiate mathematical structure if the latter can be characterized as an approximation (in Norton’s sense) of the former.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1965) \n\n“I present the case study of the anyons and fractional statistics along with the standard explanatory story found in the physics literature in Sect. 4 as an example of an indispensable mathematical explanation wherein there is no sense in” (Shech, 2019, p. 1965) \n\n“which the mathematical structure appealed to in order to explain fractional statistics is “approximately instantiated” in a physical system” (Shech, 2019, p. 1966) + \n\n“Section 5 explains that cases such as fractional statistics are a common feature of our best physical theories and entertains three nominalist objections. My hope is that it will be clear from my discussion of fractional statistics and essential, infinite/infinitesimal idealizations that the study of such examples may greatly inform the debate on easy road nominalism and, more generally, the cogency of mathematical explanations.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1966) \n\n“I conclude the paper with a short summary in Sect. 6 (and have added an “Appendix” at the end of the paper with technical details).” (Shech, 2019, p. 1966) \n\n“2 Leng’s easy road nominalism” (Shech, 2019, p. 1966) ## \n\n“3 Approximation, idealization, and approximate instantiation” (Shech, 2019, p. 1967) \n\n“I am thus suggesting a kind of condition of adequacy on any Leng-type NSR account of a phenomenon appearing in some physical target system, which appeals to the notion of “approximate instantiation:” Condition of Adequacy: Approximate instantiation can adequately justify an NRS account of a phenomenon appearing in a physical target system just in case there is a match between the relevant properties of the limit system (used to represent/model the target system) and the corresponding limit properties.17” (Shech, 2019, p. 1969) Good definition for approximate instantiation. \n\n“. It is only at the limit that the property of non-simply connectedness and nontrivial fundamental group arises. Connectedness is a binary topological property. Either the space is connected or it is not; there is no intermediate.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1972) \n\n“4 Easy road nominalism meets anyons” (Shech, 2019, p. 1973) ## \n\n“However, it turns out that in two dimensions the configuration space framework allows the exchange phase to take on any value.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1974) \n\n“The standard story found in the physics literature is that it is in virtue of the fact that the fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in two dimensions is the braid group BN” (Shech, 2019, p. 1975) \n\n“Connecting with Leng’s (2010, 2012) notion of structural explanation we may say that (a) physical FQHE systems instantiated the structure corresponding to the configuration space of identical particles in two-dimensions (since there is little to no motion in the third spatial direction), and that (b) the existence of fractional statistics is a consequence of two facts: (1) the phase factor characterizing quantum statistics is the one-dimensional unitary representation of the fundamental group of a system’s configuration space and (2) in two dimensions the fundamental group is the braid group. However, and importantly, it is no longer clear that we can dispense with reifying the explanatory mathematical structure. The reason is that, although FQHE systems are approximately two-dimensional and seem to manifest behavior consistent with fractional statistics, still, it is not the case that the mathematical structure is “approximately instantiated” as Leng’s account necessitates. The fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in approximately two dimensions is the same as that of three dimensions, the permutation group SN . In order to allow for fractional statistics we need the fundamental group to be the braid group BN , and this can only occur in exactly two dimensions. Yet, physical systems are not exactly two-dimensional. Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system “approximately instantiates” the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1977) \n\n“The fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in approximately two dimensions is the same as that of three dimensions, the permutation group SN . In order to allow for fractional statistics we need the fundamental group to be the braid group BN , and this can only occur in exactly two dimensions. Yet, physical systems are not exactly two-dimensional. Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system “approximately instantiates” the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics. S” (Shech, 2019, p. 1977) \n\n“Given that we know of cases where the success of a theory is not due to the actual existence of the ideal objects it hypothesizes, but rather due to the way in which these convenient “myths” allow us to represent some facts about real objects, is this not enough to throw into question the claim that the existence of ideal continuous fluids should be considered as confirmed by the success of fluid dynamics?” (Shech, 2019, p. 1978) \n\n“It seems to me that, unless one can successfully apply a developed NSR account, such as the expounded version of Leng’s approach, then the default answers to such questions—in the context of the case study of anyons and fractional statistics that I consider—ought to be “no.”” (Shech, 2019, p. 1978) \n\n“5 Nominalistic objections” (Shech, 2019, p. 1978) ## \n\n“But why do we need the system to be exactly, dynamically two-dimensional and not just two-dimensional “for all practical purposes?”” (Shech, 2019, p. 1980) \n\n“anyons arise when the fundamental group of the configuration space is the braid group and this happens only for two-dimensions: π1 (Q) = BN for d = 2. For a three-dimensional system that is only effectively two-dimensional the fundamental group is the symmetry group, i.e., π1 (Q) = SN for d = 3, and thus the mathematical structure is not rich enough to give rise to anyons and fractional statistics.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1980) \n\n“But the probability that one will find a particle in the third dimension in physical space in systems that manifest the FQHE is not zero (although it is extremely low, e.g., on the order of 10−44” (Shech, 2019, p. 1980) \n\n“it has been argued that fractional statistics are the results of an AB effect-type phase picked up by the particles when they circle each other” (Shech, 2019, p. 1982) \n\n“the problem is exacerbated in the context of anyons and fractional statistics since, as emphasized above, the explanatory story of the emergence of anyons told in Sect. 4.1 shows that fractional statistics arise from the topological braid group structure.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1982) \n\n“both Laughlin (1983) and Arovas et al. (1984) assume that they are working with a exactly two-dimensional system, and in such systems we know that anyons can emerge.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1982) \n\n“My suggestion then is that proponents of the easy road nominalism debate, and the debate on mathematical explanation, may benefit from attending to examples of essential, infinite/infinitesimal idealization science. E” (Shech, 2019, p. 1985) \n\n“Instead, since the particles are identical, configurations that differ only by a permutation of particles ought to correspond to the same physical state.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“. In the context of the general case, this corresponds to considering the quotient (or identification) space that one attains by diving out the permutation group SN : Q = Rd SN .” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“excise the set of diagonal points in RNd, which represent all points where the particles coincide” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“. The exclusion of the diagonal point implies that the space in not simply connected and I denote this new configuration space with ̃ Q.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“In order to extend ordinary QM to multiply connected regions we need to appeal the topological notion of a universal covering space Q of ̃ Q” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“we will want this quantity to be projectable down to ̃ Q” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“q = π (q)” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“If this condition is satisfied we say that we have a projectable quantum mechanics, a” (Shech, 2019, p. 1986) \n\n“what type” (Shech, 2019, p. 1987) \n\n“π1 ( ̃ Q ) = BN” (Shech, 2019, p. 1987) \n\n“. Second, roughly, recall that any two closed curves (loops) that can be continuously deformed into one another will be part of the same homotopy class.” (Shech, 2019, p. 1987) \n\n“while the one-dimensional representation of BN is γ(θ) = eiθ where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π” (Shech, 2019, p. 1988)",

In another paper in this journal, Foundations of statistical mechanics: Mechanics by itself, I have shown that some of the thermodynamic regularities, including the probabilistic ones, can be described in terms of mechanics by itself. But in order to prove those regularities, in particular the time asymmetric ones, it is necessary to add to mechanics assumptions of three kinds, all of which are under debate in contemporary literature. One kind of assumptions concerns measure and probability, and here, a major debate is around the notion of “typicality.” A second assumption concerns initial conditions, and here, the debate is about the nature and status of the so-called past hypothesis. The third kind of assumptions concerns the dynamics, and here, the possibility and significance of “Maxwell's Demon” is the main topic of discussions. This article describes these assumptions and examines the justification for introducing them, emphasizing the contemporary debates around them.",

Its aims are debated, its methods are contested, its main claims have never been fully proven, and their very truth is challenged, yet at the same time, it enjoys huge empirical success and gives us the feeling that we understand important phenomena.

Statistical mechanics is the name of the ongoing attempt to apply mechanics (classical, as discussed in this paper, or quantum), together with some auxiliary hypotheses, to explain and predict certain phenomena, above all those described by thermodynamics.

This not only takes the mystery out of Berry's phase factor and provides calculational simple formulas, but makes a connection between Berry's work and that of Thouless et al. This connection allows the author to use Berry's ideas to interpret the integers of Thouless et al. in terms of eigenvalue degeneracies.",

Lawrence Sklar examines three kinds of skeptical arguments about scientific truth, and explores the important role they play within foundational science itself. Sklar demonstrates that these kinds of philosophical critique are employed within science, and reveals the clear difference between how they operate in a scientific context and more abstract philosophical contexts. The underlying theme of Theory and Truth is that science and philosophy are essential to one another. Sklar advances the claim that one cannot understand the methods of science without a comprehension of philosophy, and one cannot fruitfully pursue philosophy of science without understanding fundamental science as well.",

      "abstractNote": "Ernst Mayr has argued that Darwinian theory discredited essentialist modes of thought and replaced them with what he has called \"population thinking\". In this paper, I characterize essentialism as embodying a certain conception of how variation in nature is to be explained, and show how this conception was undermined by evolutionary theory. The Darwinian doctrine of evolutionary gradualism makes it impossible to say exactly where one species ends and another begins; such line-drawing problems are often taken to be the decisive reason for thinking that essentialism is untenable. However, according to the view of essentialism I suggest, this familiar objection is not fatal to essentialism. It is rather the essentialist's use of what I call the natural state model for explaining variation which clashes with evolutionary theory. This model implemented the essentialist's requirement that properties of populations be defined in terms of properties of member organisms. Requiring such constituent definitions is reductionistic in spirit; additionally, evolutionary theory shows that such definitions are not available, and, moreover, that they are not needed to legitimize population-level concepts. Population thinking involves the thesis that population concepts may be legitimized by showing their connections with each other, even when they are not reducible to concepts applying at lower levels of organization. In the paper, I develop these points by describing Aristotle's ideas on the origins of biological variation; they are a classic formulation of the natural state model. I also describe how the development of statistical ideas in the 19th century involved an abandoning of the natural state model.",

      "abstractNote": "This article stipulates that vagueness is a socially important yet academically largely overlooked aspect of human interaction with the world. Vagueness and vague experiences can structure material categorisations of the world; it can contribute to the shaping of social relations and nurture the appreciation of difficult experiences. However, the recent archaeological (re)turn to science as the main provider of knowledge of the past renders vagueness futile as an empirical occurrence through its exorcism of elusiveness and ambiguity in the notorious pursuit of absolute, exact and quantifiable facts. This article challenges the pursuit and use of exact data in archaeological science and the consequential implications of the omission of vague occurrences, discussing the problem that ambiguous and absent evidence become neglected in subsequent conclusion. Second, it is demonstrated that vagueness and ambiguity can be integral to certain social and material phenomena. Third, the article examines recent archaeological analyses of burial practices in South Scandinavian passage graves from the Middle Neolithic in order to discuss the pursuit of certitude in archaeological observations and interpretations. Finally, it is argued that the idealisation of certitude in archaeological analysis needs to be complemented by an interpretative framework making it possible to recognise vagueness as a social phenomenon.",

      "abstractNote": "<p>Quantum computation requires controlled engineering of quantum states to perform tasks that go beyond those possible with classical computers. Topological quantum computation aims to achieve this goal by using non-Abelian quantum phases of matter. Such phases allow for quantum information to be stored and manipulated in a nonlocal manner, which protects it from imperfections in the implemented protocols and from interactions with the environment. Recently, substantial progress in this field has been made on both theoretical and experimental fronts. We review the basic concepts of non-Abelian phases and their topologically protected use in quantum information processing tasks. We discuss different possible realizations of these concepts in experimentally available solid-state systems, including systems hosting Majorana fermions, their recently proposed fractional counterparts, and non-Abelian quantum Hall states.</p>",

Together with a detailed introduction by the editor, this volume serves as a stimulating and valuable reference for students and research workers in condensed matter physics and for those with a particle physics background. The papers have been chosen with the intention of emphasizing the topological aspects of the quantum Hall effect and its connections with other branches of theoretical physics, such as topological quantum field theories and string theory. The contents include sections on integer effect, fractional effect, effect of global topology, effective theories, edge states and non-Abelian statistics.",

      "abstractNote": "Robert Batterman and others have argued that certain idealizing explanations have an asymptotic form: they account for a state of affairs or behavior by showing that it emerges “in the limit”. Asymptotic idealizations are interesting in many ways, but is there anything special about them as idealizations? To understand their role in science, must we augment our philosophical theories of idealization? This paper uses simple examples of asymptotic idealization in population genetics to argue for an affirmative answer and proposes a general schema for asymptotic idealization, drawing on insights from Batterman’s treatment and from John Norton’s subsequent critique.",

This numbering scheme does not, of course, represent any biologically relevant properties. It may not represent any real property at all. The point is solely to give the model sufficient structure to sustain limiting as well as relative frequencies. As far as I can see, such a strategy is viable. But I do not think that it is the route actually taken by population geneticists. They do not countenance additional structure in their models; nor do they supply, or think that they need to supply, the mathematics that will take advantage of such structure to provide the “strong law” conclusion that evolution will with probability one match expected frequencies.9 The first two interpretations of the infinite population idealization, then, are inadequate. If my reading is correct, then population geneticists such as Gillespie and Edwards treat deterministic models as genuine models that can be used (when circumstances are right) to explain real events. Further, many of them—Gillespie, for example—take seriously the idea that such models chart the course of evolution in systems with infinitely large populations. But they have no interest in putting into the models the mathematical structure that is required to represent infinite populations b”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F6193144%2Fitems%2FENYIJVXW%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221723%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Strevens, 2019, p. 1723</span>)</span></p></div>",

This numbering scheme does not, of course, represent any biologically relevant properties. It may not represent any real property at all. The point is solely to give the model sufficient structure to sustain limiting as well as relative frequencies. As far as I can see, such a strategy is viable. But I do not think that it is the route actually taken by population geneticists. They do not countenance additional structure in their models; nor do they supply, or think that they need to supply, the mathematics that will take advantage of such structure to provide the “strong law” conclusion that evolution will with probability one match expected frequencies.9 The first two interpretations of the infinite population idealization, then, are inadequate. If my reading is correct, then population geneticists such as Gillespie and Edwards treat deterministic models as genuine models that can be used (when circumstances are right) to explain real events. Further, many of them—Gillespie, for example—take seriously the idea that such models chart the course of evolution in systems with infinitely large populations. But they have no interest in putting into the models the mathematical structure that is required to represent infinite populations b”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F6193144%2Fitems%2FENYIJVXW%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221723%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Strevens, 2019, p. 1723</span>)</span> Im so great</p></div>",

      "abstractNote": "Robert Batterman and others have argued that certain idealizing explanations have an asymptotic form: they account for a state of affairs or behavior by showing that it emerges “in the limit”. Asymptotic idealizations are interesting in many ways, but is there anything special about them as idealizations? To understand their role in science, must we augment our philosophical theories of idealization? This paper uses simple examples of asymptotic idealization in population genetics to argue for an affirmative answer and proposes a general schema for asymptotic idealization, drawing on insights from Batterman’s treatment and from John Norton’s subsequent critique.",

      "abstractNote": "The discovery of the quantum Hall effect (QHE)1,2 in two-dimensional electronic systems has given topology a central role in condensed matter physics. Although the possibility of generalizing the QHE to three-dimensional (3D) electronic systems3,4 was proposed decades ago, it has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of the 3D QHE in bulk zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) crystals. We perform low-temperature electric-transport measurements on bulk ZrTe5 crystals under a magnetic field and achieve the extreme quantum limit, where only the lowest Landau level is occupied, at relatively low magnetic fields. In this regime, we observe a dissipationless longitudinal resistivity close to zero, accompanied by a well-developed Hall resistivity plateau proportional to half of the Fermi wavelength along the field direction. This response is the signature of the 3D QHE and strongly suggests a Fermi surface instability driven by enhanced interaction effects in the extreme quantum limit. By further increasing the magnetic field, both the longitudinal and Hall resistivity increase considerably and display a metal–insulator transition, which represents another magnetic-field-driven quantum phase transition. Our findings provide experimental evidence of the 3D QHE and a promising platform for further exploration of exotic quantum phases and transitions in 3D systems.",

The focus is on the interplay between microscopic wavefunctions, long-distance effective Chern-Simons theories, and the modes which live on the boundary. The notes are aimed at graduate students in any discipline where $\\hbar=1$. A working knowledge of quantum field theory is assumed. Contents: 1. The Basics (Landau levels and Berry phase). 2. The Integer Quantum Hall Effect. 3. The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect. 4. Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States. 5. Chern-Simons Theories. 6. Edge Modes.",

      "abstractNote": "The principle of maximum entropy is a general method to assign values to probability distributions on the basis of partial information. This principle, introduced by Jaynes in 1957, forms an extension of the classical principle of insufficient reason. It has been further generalized, both in mathematical formulation and in intended scope, into the principle of maximum relative entropy or of minimum information. It has been claimed that these principles are singled out as unique methods of statistical inference that agree with certain compelling consistency requirements. This paper reviews these consistency arguments and the surrounding controversy. It is shown that the uniqueness proofs are flawed, or rest on unreasonably strong assumptions. A more general class of inference rules, maximizing the so-called Rényi entropies, is exhibited which also fulfill the reasonable part of the consistency assumptions.",

      "abstractNote": "The principle of maximum entropy is a method for assigning values to probability distributions on the basis of partial information. In usual formulations of this and related methods of inference one assumes that this partial information takes the form of a constraint on allowed probability distributions. In practical applications, however, the information consists of empirical data. A constraint rule is then employed to construct constraints on probability distributions out of these data. Usually one adopts the rule that equates the expectation values of certain functions with their empirical averages. There are, however, various other ways in which one can construct constraints from empirical data, which makes the maximum entropy principle lead to very different probability assignments. This paper shows that an argument by Jaynes to justify the usual constraint rule is unsatisfactory and investigates several alternative choices. The choice of a constraint rule is also shown to be of crucial importance to the debate on the question whether there is a conflict between the methods of inference based on maximum entropy and Bayesian conditionalization.",

      "abstractNote": "The aim of this article is to analyse the relation between the second law of thermodynamics and the so-called arrow of time. For this purpose, a number of different aspects in this arrow of time are distinguished, in particular those of time-reversal (non-)invariance and of (ir)reversibility. Next I review versions of the second law in the work of Carnot, Clausius, Kelvin, Planck, Gibbs, Carathéodory and Lieb and Yngvason, and investigate their connection with these aspects of the arrow of time. It is shown that this connection varies a great deal along with these formulations of the second law. According to the famous formulation by Planck, the second law expresses the irreversibility of natural processes. But in many other formulations irreversibility or even time-reversal non-invariance plays no role. I therefore argue for the view that the second law has nothing to do with the arrow of time.",

      "abstractNote": "The English verb ‘reduce’, derives from the Latin‘reducere’, whose literal meaning ‘to bringback’, informs its metaphorical use in philosophy. If oneasserts that the mental reduces to the physical, that heat reduces tokinetic molecular energy, or that one theory reduces to anothertheory, one implies that in some relevant sense the reduced theory canbe brought back to the reducing theory, the mental can bebrought back to the physical, or heat can be broughtback to molecular kinetic energy. The term‘reduction’ as used in philosophy expresses the idea thatif an entity x reduces to an entity y then y isin a sense prior to x, is more basic thanx, is such that x fully depends upon it or isconstituted by it. Saying that x reduces to ytypically implies that x is nothing more than yor nothing over and above y., Though the term ‘reduction’ in this use may not correspondto everyday use nor to scientific discourse, its technical meaning isnot fixed by mere stipulation. ‘Reduction’ is a term ofnatural language, and, building upon its common metaphoric meaningphilosophers use it to designate relations of particular philosophicalimportance in a number of closely related fields, especially in thephilosophy of science, the philosophy of mind, and metaphysics., The notion of scientific reduction as used in contemporaryanalytic philosophy differs from conceptions of reduction according towhich we learn about the instantiation of reduction-relations on apurely a priori basis from basic religious, metaphysical orepistemological principles. ‘Scientific reduction’ appliesto reductionist claims supposedly justified by scientific evidence andthe success of science., Different accounts of scientific reduction have shaped debates aboutdiverse topics including scientific unification, the relation between(folk-)psychology and neuroscience, themetaphysics of the mind, the status of biology vis àvis chemistry, and the relation between allegedly teleologicalexplanations and causal explanations. Understanding the relevantnotions is thus a prerequisite for understanding key issues incontemporary analytic philosophy. Moreover, the notion of reductionitself has become a target of recent philosophical discussion,especially in the philosophy of science and in metaphysics.",

      "abstractNote": "The development of rigorous foundations of differential calculus in the course of the nineteenth century led to concerns among physicists about its applicability in physics. Through this development, differential calculus was made independent of empirical and intuitive notions of continuity, and based instead on strictly mathematical conditions of continuity. However, for Boltzmann and Poincaré, the applicability of mathematics in physics depended on whether there is a basis in physics, intuition or experience for the fundamental axioms of mathematics—and this meant that to determine the status of differential equations in physics, they had to consider whether there was a justification for these mathematical continuity conditions in physics. For this reason, their ideas about continuity and discreteness in nature were entangled with epistemology and philosophy of mathematics. They reached opposite conclusions: Poincaré argued that physicists must work with a continuous representation of nature, and thus with differential equations, while Boltzmann argued that physicists must ultimately take nature to be discrete.",

      "abstractNote": "The paradox of phase transitions raises the problem of how to reconcile the fact that we see phase transitions happen in concrete, finite systems around us, with the fact that our best theories—i.e. statistical-mechanical theories of phase transitions—tell us that phase transitions occur only in infinite systems. In this paper we aim to clarify to which extent this paradox is relative to the mathematical framework which is used in these theories, i.e. classical mathematics. To this aim, we will explore the philosophical consequences of adopting constructive instead of classical mathematics in a statistical-mechanical theory of phase transitions. It will be shown that constructive mathematics forces certain ‘de-idealizations' of such theories: talk of actually infinite systems is meaningless, there are no discontinuous functions, and—in a sense which will be clarified—constructive real numbers reflect our imperfect methods of determining the values of physical quantities. As such, so it will be argued, constructive mathematics offers a means to gain insight in the idealizations introduced in classical theories and the philosophical issues surrounding them.",

      "abstractNote": "We think of a boundary whenever we think of an entity demarcated fromits surroundings. There is a boundary (a line) separating Maryland andPennsylvania. There is a boundary (a circle) isolating the interior ofa disc from its exterior. There is a boundary (a surface) enclosingthe bulk of this apple. Sometimes the exact location of a boundary isunclear or otherwise controversial (as when you try to trace out themargins of Mount Everest, or even the boundary of your ownbody). Sometimes the boundary lies skew to any physical discontinuityor qualitative differentiation (as with the border of Wyoming, or theboundary between the upper and lower halves of a homogeneoussphere). But whether sharp or blurry, natural or artificial, for everyobject there appears to be a boundary that marks it off from the restof the world. Events, too, have boundaries — at least temporalboundaries. Our lives are bounded by our births and by our deaths; thesoccer game began at 3pm sharp and ended with the referee's finalwhistle at 4:45pm. It is sometimes suggested that even abstractentities, such as concepts or sets, have boundaries of their own, andWittgenstein could emphatically proclaim that the boundaries of ourlanguage are the boundaries of our world (1921: 5.6). Whether all thisboundary talk is coherent, however, and whether it reflects thestructure of the world or simply the organizing activity of our mind,are matters of deep philosophical controversy.",

First an argument is presented to the effect that there is prima facie evidence that the soritical series is incompatible with a transition from one opposite to the other. Then two positions are critically reviewed: nihilism and discontinuism (two of whose varieties are the so-called epistemicism and supervaluationism). Both are found wanting in that none has adequate answers to our two queries. Finally a solution is developed which accommodates the graduality of the transition, and its contradictoriality. Thus a contradictorial gradualism is shown to be all that is demanded to account for the phenomenon.",

The measurement of the Hall resistance showed that electronic resistance could be defined precisely in terms of fundamental constants, even in a disordered and irregular sample. Over the past 40 years, the QHE has inspired new theories and led to experimental discoveries in a range of fields going beyond solid-state electronics to photonics and quantum entanglement. In this Viewpoint, physicists reflect on how the QHE has influenced their research.",

Recently, some philosophers have claimed that idealizations can be used to underwrite explanation nonetheless but only when they are what have variously been called representational, Galilean, controllable, or harmless idealizations. This article argues that such a half-measure is untenable and that idealizations not of this sort can have explanatory capacities.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent work by Robert Batterman and Alexander Rueger has brought attention to cases in physics in which governing laws at the base level “break down” and singular limit relations obtain between base- and upper-level theories. As a result, they claim, these are cases with emergent upper-level properties. This paper contends that this inference—from singular limits to explanatory failure, novelty or irreducibility, and then to emergence—is mistaken. The van der Pol nonlinear oscillator is used to show that there can be a full explanation of upper-level properties entirely in base-level terms even when singular limits are present. Whether upper-level properties are emergent depends not on the presence of a singular limit but rather on details of the ampliative approximation methods used. The paper suggests that focusing on explanatory deficiency at the base level is key to understanding emergence in physics.",

      "abstractNote": "As anyone who has flown out of a cloud knows, the boundaries of acloud are a lot less sharp up close than they can appear on the ground.Even when it seems clearly true that there is one, sharply bounded,cloud up there, really there are thousands of water droplets that areneither determinately part of the cloud, nor determinately outside it.Consider any object that consists of the core of the cloud, plus anarbitrary selection of these droplets. It will look like a cloud, andcircumstances permitting rain like a cloud, and generally has as good aclaim to be a cloud as any other object in that part of the sky. But wecannot say every such object is a cloud, else there would be millionsof clouds where it seemed like there was one. And what holds for cloudsholds for anything whose boundaries look less clear the closer you lookat it. And that includes just about every kind of object we normallythink about, including humans. Although this seems to be a merelytechnical puzzle, even a triviality, a surprising range of proposedsolutions has emerged, many of them mutually inconsistent. It is noteven settled whether a solution should come from metaphysics, or fromphilosophy of language, or from logic. Here we survey the options, andprovide several links to the many topics related to the Problem.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper describes a theory of accuracy or approximate truth and applies it to problems in the realist interpretation of scientific theories. It argues not only that realism requires approximate truth, but that an adequate theory of approximation also presupposes some elements of a realist interpretation of theories. The paper distinguishes approximate truth from vagueness, probability and verisimilitude, and applies it to problems of confirmation and deduction from inaccurate premises. Basic results are cited, but details appear elsewhere. Objections are surveyed, including arguments by Miller, Laymon, and Laudan. Comparison is made with Niiniluoto's theory of verisimilitude, and the utility of his theory for realism assessed.",

It will be useful for advanced undergraduates, for post-graduate students undertaking research in related fields, and for established researchers in experimental physics, chemistry, and metallurgy as an exposition of current theoretical understanding. - ;Recent developments have led to a good understanding of universality; why phase transitions in systems as diverse as magnets, fluids, liquid crystals, and superconductors can be brought under the same theoretical umbrella and well described by simple models. This book describes the physics underlying universality and then lays out the theoretical approaches now available for studying phase transitions. Traditional techniques, mean-field theory, series expansions, and the transfer matrix, are described; the Monte Carlo method is covered, and two chapters are devoted to the renormalization group, which led to a break-through in the field. The book will be useful as a textbook for a course in `Phase Transitions&#39;, as an introduction for graduate students undertaking research in related fields, and as an overview for scientists in other disciplines who work with phase transitions but who are not aware of the current tools in the armoury of the theoretical physicist. - ;Introduction; Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics; Models; Mean-field theories; The transfer matrix; Series expansions; Monte Carlo simulations; The renormalization group; Implementations of the renormalization group. -",

      "abstractNote": "The principal methods for the definition of thermodynamic entropy are discussed with special reference to those developed by Carathéodory, the Keenan School, Lieb and Yngvason, and the present authors. An improvement of the latter method is then presented. Seven basic axioms are employed: three Postulates, which are considered as having a quite general validity, and four Assumptions, which identify the domains of validity of the definitions of energy (Assumption 1) and entropy (Assumptions 2, 3, 4). The domain of validity of the present definition of entropy is not restricted to stable equilibrium states. For collections of simple systems, it coincides with that of the proof of existence and uniqueness of an entropy function which characterizes the relation of adiabatic accessibility proposed by Lieb and Yngvason. However, our treatment does not require the formation of scaled copies so that it applies not only to collections of simple systems, but also to systems contained in electric or magnetic fields and to small and few-particle systems.",

      "abstractNote": "I review arguments demonstrating how the concept of “particle” numbers arises in the form of equidistant energy eigenvalues of coupled harmonic oscillators representing free fields. Their quantum numbers (numbers of nodes of the wave functions) can be interpreted as occupation numbers for objects with a formal mass (defined by the field equation) and spatial wave number (“momentum”) characterizing classical field modes. A superposition of different oscillator eigenstates, all consisting of n modes having one node, while all others have none, defines a non-degenerate “n-particle wave function”. Other discrete properties and phenomena (such as particle positions and “events”) can be understood by means of the fast but continuous process of decoherence: the irreversible dislocalization of superpositions. Any wave-particle dualism thus becomes obsolete. The observation of individual outcomes of this decoherence process in measurements requires either a subsequent collapse of the wave function or a “branching observer” in accordance with the Schrödinger equation—both possibilities applying clearly after the decoherence process. Any probability interpretation of the wave function in terms of local elements of reality, such as particles or other classical concepts, would open a Pandora’s box of paradoxes, as is illustrated by various misnomers that have become popular in quantum theory.",
