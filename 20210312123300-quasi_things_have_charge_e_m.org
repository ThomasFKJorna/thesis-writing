* Quasi-holes/particles carry charge e/m

** Intuition
This can be "intuited" by looking at the WF of the hole ([[id:91cc9a2b-8dd0-45c9-990e-127c413b907e][where does the hole WF come from?]])
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{hole}(z_i) = \prod_{i=1}(z_i-\eta)\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{z_i}^2/4l_B^2}
    \label{eq:holeLWF}
\end{equation}


 or, more generally, the WF of many holes
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{M-hole}(z_i) = \prod_{j=1}^M \prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\eta)\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{z_i}^2/4l_B^2}
    \label{eq:manyholeLWF}
\end{equation}

We note that if $M=m$, the WF will simply look like

\begin{equation}
    \psi_{m-hole}(z; \eta) = \prod_{i=1}^N (z_i-\eta)^m \prod_{k<l} (z_k-z_l)^m e^{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{z_i}^2/4l_B^2}
    \label{eq:holeiselectronLWF}
\end{equation}

If we squint our eyes and look at \eta as another electron, then this would simply be the N+1 LWF. But it's not, \eta is the absence of an electron. Since $m$ $\eta$s make one 'electron', it's reasonable to assume that one \eta has charge $q=e\m$.

** Berry Connection
The above "proof" is rather shoddy. However, we can make a more educated guess by looking using the [[id:3dad96b9-a6bf-449f-981e-4e141f865dd5][Berry Connection]]

However, this is too difficult to calculate, so we need to
#+transclusion: t
[[id:09d72e19-5fe2-445e-becb-86ef45bf86b0][Screening Allows us to Calculate the Berry Connection]]

which ends up being
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}_{\eta_i} =& -\frac{i}{2m}\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{1}{\eta_i-\eta_j}+\frac{i\bar{\eta}_i}{4ml_B^2}//
    \mathcal{A}_{\bar{\eta}_i} =& ++\frac{i}{2m}\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{1}{\bar{\eta}_i-\bar{\eta}_j}-+\frac{i\eta_i}{4ml_B^2}
    \label{eq:berryconnection}
\end{align}

...

Tada we get the right answer
