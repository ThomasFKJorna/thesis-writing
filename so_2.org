* SO(2)

The special orthogonal group *SO(2)* is the [[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]] of all [[file:orthogonal.org][Orthogonal]]  $2x2$  matrices with [[file:20210511133056-determinant.org][Determinant]] $1$ under matrix multiplications.

The group composes all matrices which are orthogonal, i.e. $O^T O =1$, and $\det(O)=+!$

A common [[file:representation.org][Representation]] of this group are matrices of the form
\begin{equation}
R_\phi=
\begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(\theta)&-\sin(\theta)\\
    \sin(\theta)&\cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq:so2rep}
\end{equation}

$SO(2)$ is relevant for physics, because it describes rotations in the $2D$ plane.

It is a subgroup of the general orthogonal group [[file:o_2.org][O(2)]], which does not have the $\det=1$ restriction, and describes rotations and /reflections/ in the $2D$ plane.

$SO(2)$ is [[file:isomorphism.org][isomorphic]] to the scalar unitary group [[file:u_1.org][U(1)]]
