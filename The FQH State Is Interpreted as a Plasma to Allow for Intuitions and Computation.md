# The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions

In order to get a grip on the FQHE, people resort to looking at [[The Laughlin Wavefunction]]  as a plasma, because while the Laughlin WF is easy to write down, it is hard to calculate with.

This is done like....

From the plasma analogy, we can intuit that

[[The FQH 'Plasma' Is Liquid for M<70 and Solid Above|The FQH "Plasma" Is Liquid for m<70 and Solid Above]]

[[Screening Allows us to Calculate the Berry Connection]]
