# Not being able to smoothly disentangle your worldline leads to Fractional Statistics (somehow)

We know that in [[Braided Worldlines Cannot be Disentangled in 2D]], and in that because of this particles seemingly "remember" there path through spacetime, but how does this yield [[Fractional Quantum Statistics]]?

There are two ways to answer that question

[[The Quantum Statistics of a Particle are Determined by the 1D representation of its Fundamental Group]]

Since the fundamental group of two particles in 2D space is the [[braid group]] and the 1D rep of said group is  $e^{i2\pi\alpha}\quad\alpha\in[0,1]$ (why?), it also picks up that phase factor badabing badaboom.

The other answer comes from calculating the Berry phase...
