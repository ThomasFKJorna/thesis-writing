# Things I want to communicate in this chapter
- we normally think of two types of particles: fermions and bosons. 
- The reason for this is exchangeability
- Exchangeability can be defined using path-uniqueness
- Path-uniqueness can be defined topologically or geometrically
- Topologically it’s a bit easier, so we tend to do that

# Comments on Anyons

- [ ] Make a note: [[Explaining away the anyons using geometry is kind of the same as explaining away phase transitions: you can do it but you lose universality]]
- [ ] Flip the order of III: first introduce Shech’s point, then go through the FQHE, see “huh, kinda cringe”, *then* go through the topological stuff.
- [ ] Make an animation making it plausible that “paths being the same” = “homotopy”

# Things to ask supes
