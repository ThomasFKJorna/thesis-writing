[[The Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation]] is like

1) True events
2) True law of nature
3) Prediction of event.

Thus, C is explained by 1 $\and$ 2.

What EIA does is look at DN and make up a story that allows us to predict C, then says "1 and 2 are true because they explain C". This is weird.
