**Homeomorphic** means "topologically-equivalent". It is an [[Isomporphism]] for [[Topological space|Topological spaces]], meaning that two spaces which are homeomorphic to one another have all the same topological qualities such as connectedness and orientability.

More formally, two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are **homeomorphic** iff there exists a **homeomorphism** $f: X\rightarrow Y$ such that

1) $f$ is [[Bijective or One-to-One-Correspondence|Bijective / One-to-one-correspondence]]
2) $f$ is [[Continuity (function)|continuous]]
3) The [[Inverse function]] $f^{-1}$ exists and is continuous.
