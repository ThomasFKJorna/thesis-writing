# de dicto

_de dicto_ (about what is said) means that a statement is read semantically, that the statement is ultimately about our lkinguistic practices, not about the world as it really really is.

This distinction can be drawn in a lot of different ways, but the most relevant ones concerns modality and belief. Belief is eaasiest.

# Belief

Ralph believes that someone is a spy

1) Ralph believes that there are spies (de dicto)
2) Someone exists of which Ralph believes they are a spy (de re)

Only 2 would make the FBI interested in Ralph, as "someone" refers to a specific person, while in 1. Ralph just has the general belief that a spy exists.

# Metaphysics

It is unclear whether someone that is 1.80m tall

The de dicto reading claims that it is indeterminate whether a person 1.80m in height falls within the set of bald people. However, the set of bald people is determinate.

The de re reading clamins instead that the set of all bald people has fuzzy boundaries, i.e. it just is the case that there is no fact of the matter where the edges of bald people are.
