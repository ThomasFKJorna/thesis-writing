# Fractional Quantum Statistics

# Fractional quantum statistics is gaining a phase   1 after exchanging two identical particles

FQS is a specific form of [[Quantum Statistics]], the phase factor identical particles pick up after exchange, which give rise to a new type of particle called [[anyons]]. Anyons differ from particles with[[Bose-Eistein Statistics]] or [[Fermi-Dirac Statistics]] , i.e. [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as the phase factor they pick up after exchange is

$$
\Psi_{21}=e^{i2\pi\alpha}\Psi{12}\quad \alpha\in(0,1)
$$
