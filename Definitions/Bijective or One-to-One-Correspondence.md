# Bijective or One-to-One-Correspondence

A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is called **bijective** iff it is both [[Injective  or  one-to-one|Injective / one-to-one]] and [[Surjective  or  Onto|Surjective / Onto]].

When this happens, all elements of $B$ have a unique element in $A$ which corresponds to it.
This allows us to define the [[Inverse function]]
