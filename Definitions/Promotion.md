# Promotion
The **promotion** of an approximation to an idealization [@Norton2012] consists in taking the assertion made by the approximation about the target system to be (a part of) the description of a new target system, and then considering this target system to be the new object of study.

Contra to [[Demotion]], it is not always possible to perform a promotion. We can identify two specific categories of such cases:
1. The idealized system  cannot exist
2. The target system is in direct contradiction
