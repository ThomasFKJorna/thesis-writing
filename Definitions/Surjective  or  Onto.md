# Surjective / Onto

A [[function or mapping|function/mapping]] $f:A \rightarrow B$ is called **surjective** or **onto** if every element in $B$ is the [[Image]] of some element in $A$.

$\forall b\in B \quad \exists a \in A:\quad b=f(a)$

Note that this does not mean that each $a$ uniquely maps to an $f(a)$, for instance the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} = x^2$ maps both $1$ and $-1$ $\in A$ to $1$ $\in B$.

This happens if the function is both surjective and [[Injective  or  one-to-one|Injective / one-to-one]], and it is then called [[Bijective or One-to-One-Correspondence|Bijective / One-to-one-correspondence]].
