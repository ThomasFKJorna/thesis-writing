# The deductive-nomological model

Explanation qua derivation. A phenomena $E$ is said to be explained if and only if it is the result of a deductive argument which contains at least one law of nature.

P1. Event P2. Law of nature: if X then Y.

1) Phenomenon

Example:
A ball is dropped If things are dropped, they accelerate towards the ground at $9.81m/s^2$

1) The ball falls at $9.81m/s^2$.

   The ball falling at this speed is thus explained by the conjunction of Newtonian Gravity and the fact that it has been dropped.
