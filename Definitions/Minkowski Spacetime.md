**Minkowski spacetime** is a $4D$ [[Metric Space|Metric Space,]] using the [[Minkowski Metric]] together with [[Proper time]] as a metric function. It behaves much like $\mathbb{R}^4$, except that the metric is slightly different.

It is the general stage upon which [[Special Relativity]] is set, and does not account for gravity.
