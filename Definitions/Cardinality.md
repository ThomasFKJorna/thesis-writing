The **cardinality** of a [[Set]] describes the size of said set.

# Examples

## Discrete

The caridinality of the set  $\{1,2,3\}$ is $3$, as it has 3 elements.

## Countable

The cardinality of the set of all natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is $\aleph_0$.
All sets which can be brought in one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$ are said to be [[Countable infinity|Countably infinite]].

## Uncountable

The cardinality of the set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is $\aleph_1$.
