When you **parallel transport** a vector through some curved space, it will, in general, not end up at the exact same angle (wrt to the origin) as it had at the start.

You can think of parallel transport as taking a vector _tangent_ to the surface of some manifold on a journey from and then back to its starting point.

It is, in general, _path dependent_: it matters _how_ you get to the endpoint, not just _where_.
