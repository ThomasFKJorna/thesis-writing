# Universal Explanation

Coined by [@Batterman2001], a **universal explanation** is an explanation which does not depend on the physics or specific (often microscopic) make-up of the system in which the phenomena takes place. The universal explanation, rather than a local [[Causal-mechanical explanation]] , either discards all the microscopic details or at least many of them.

It shares some similarities with [[Unification model of explanation]]
