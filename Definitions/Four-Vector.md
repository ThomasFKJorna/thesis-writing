# Four-vector

A **four-vector** is vector-form often used in [[Special Relativity|relativistic]] physics, defined as

$$
x_\mu=\begin{pmatrix}x_0\\x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $x_0$ is often time or a time-relevant quantity such as energy.

The lenght of a four vector is

$$
x^2=x\cdot x\equiv x_\mu x_\nu  \eta^{\mu\nu}
$$

where $\eta$ is the [[Minkowski Metric]].

The most common four vector is the proper time $\tau$, whose length is the invariant quantity in special relativity.
