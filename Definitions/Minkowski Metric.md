The **Minkowski Metric** $\eta$ is a [[Metric]]   describing how to measure distances in [[Minkowski Spacetime]], which is the standard spacetime [[Special Relativity]] is set in. It is defined as

$$
\eta=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 &0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 &0 &-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Or with the sign of the diagonal entries inversed, depending on the convention chosen by the author (very field dependent).

Another way to define the Minkowski metric is as the object left invariant under transformations of the [[Lorentz Group]] on [[Minkowski Spacetime]]
