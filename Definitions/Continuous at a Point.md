Let X and Y be [[Topological space]]s and $f: X \rightarrow Y$. If for a point $x \in X$ and each [[Neighborhood]] $V$ of $f(x)$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)\subset V$, then $f$ is said to be **continuous at the point** $x$.

If $f$ is continuous at all points $x \in X$, $f$ is said to be [[Continuity (function)|continuous]].
