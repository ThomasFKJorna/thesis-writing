A **connection** is an operation that allows for [[Parallel transport]] over [[Vector Bundle|Vector Bundles]].

Physicists often refer to this as a "vector potential" instead, as "all vector potentials defined over a vector bundle must differ by a _connection_ much like how all vector potentials attributed to an electromagnetic field are related to one another by a [[Gauge symmetry|gauge transformation]]" [@Cohen2019] (pp.440)
