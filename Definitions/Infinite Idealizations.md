# infinite idealizations

Infinite idealizations are idealizations where some property of the idealization is set to infinity (or zero, in which case they are called infinitesimal idealizations). The most central case is the so called [[thermodynamic limit]], where, in order to predict certain thermodynamic behavior from statistical mechanics, the number of particles of the relevant system goes to infinity while the volume of every particle goes to zero, keeping the density constant.

Interesting cases of infinite idealizations occur when the properties of this limit system fail to match the properties of the target system, i.e. fail to be an approximation, see [[What is the difference between infinite idealizations and normal ones or |What is the difference between infinite idealizations and normal ones]]. This can happen for two reasons

1) there does not exist a  N=infinity model
2) N=infinity model has properties which are opposed to the actual, finite model.

It is sometimes difficult to tell when 2. occurs, see . For instance, in the TDL, is having an infinite number of particles already different enough from the finite system to warrant saying that they do not match?

Infinite idealizations differ from so called "simple" idealizations, in that
