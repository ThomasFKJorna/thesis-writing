* Topological Space

** Munkres
A *topological space* is an ordered pair $(X, T)$ consiisting of any set $X$ which has a [[file:20210506162317-topology.org][Topology]] $T$ specified on it.

This is similar to the idea of a [[file:20210416111039-metric_space.org][Metric Space]], except instead of defining a metric you define a topology.

*** With open sets

A *topological space* $X$ is a set $X$ together with a collection of subsets of $X$, called  [[file:20210416112309-open_set.org][Open set]]s, such that
1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open
2. Arbitrary /unions/ of open subsets of $X$ are also open
3. Arbitrary /intersections/ of open subsets of $X$ are also open
