# Philosopheren kun je leren

Philosophy often brings me down and I feel like I'm not cut out for it. But still, I love it so much, and think it's the most intellectually fulfilling thing you can do, because it's about getting in the nitty gritty of things and because [[Philosophy is the opposite of blackboxing]].

Just like anything, of course, you can learn how to philosophize, even though I've kind of forgot both how to and that fact in the recent year. But it can be really simple: stop and think about _why_ something would work that way. Wonder. Get mad! Think you are the smartest fucker alive. I'm not sure where this note is going but boi am I feeling it.
