* Homeomorphic

*Homeomorphic* means "topologically-equivalent". It is an [[id:b671608b-4efc-4c3a-afea-5e392abaa86c][Isomporphism]] for [[id:5061d36d-a542-45d3-b76a-b6744c0df01a][Topological spaces]], meaning that two spaces which are homeomorphic to one another have all the same topological qualities such as connectedness and orientability.

More formally, two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are *homeomorphic* iff there exists a *homeomorphism* $f: X\rightarrow Y$ such that
1. $f$ is [[id:1b978913-f923-48e8-b1e7-d0a42527dd5b][Bijective / One-to-one-correspondence]]
2. $f$ is [[id:0facab0b-4652-478e-962a-afb8cf9818bb][continuous]]
3. The [[id:2e3c5d06-832e-4f7d-aa12-a8fbb9c4bdb3][Inverse function]] $f^{-1}$ exists and is continuous.
