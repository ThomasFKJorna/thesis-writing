# Nominalist Scientific Realism

> [!definition]
> The view that the nominalistic content of empirical science—that is, what empirical science entails about the physical world—is true (or mostly true...), while its platonistic content—that is, what it entails “about” an abstract mathematical realm—is fictional. [@Balaguer1998 p. 131]
