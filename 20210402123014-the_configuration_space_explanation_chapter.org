* The configuration space explanation of anyons

In this section I will give a brief expose of the purported explanation of the possibility/emergence of anyons via the "configuration space framework", mostly based on cite:Shech2019, cite:Shech2015b, cite:Rao2001 and cite:Tong2016.


** The quantum statistics of a particle are the phase factor it obtains under exchange

The quantum statistics of a particle is the "factor" the system picks up under exchange of two identical particles. In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named "anyons".

A particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.

** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space

How do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?
We have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.

As mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.

Using the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.

** Naive exchange

In order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):

We start out with a wavefunction $\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$
\[\Psi_0=\psi_1\psi_2\]

If we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]

\[\Psi_\pi=e^{i\theta\pi}\psi_2\psi_1\]

Exchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with

\[\Psi_{2\pi}=e^{i2\pi\theta}\Psi_0\]

Therefore, $e^{i2\pi\theta}=1 \rightarrow e^{i\pi\theta}=\pm 1$, which leads to $\theta=0 \lor \theta=1$.

We have therefore "shown" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\theta=0$) and fermions ($\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.

** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not "the operator framework" )

What we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.

(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)

The three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation

\begin{equation}
[S_i,S_j]=i\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K
    \label{eq:spincomm}
\end{equation}


If we take the state $\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like

\begin{equation}
S^2\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\ket{s,m}
    \label{eq:spinsquared}
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
S_3\ket{s,m}=m\ket{s,m}
    \label{eq:s3}
\end{equation}

then we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as

\begin{equation}
S^+\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\ket{s,m+1}=\ket{s,m'}
    \label{eq:splus}
\end{equation}

If we require $\sqrt{|\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get

\begin{equation}
s(s+1)-m(m+1)\geq0 \quad \forall m
    \label{eq:posnorm}
\end{equation}

Thus
\begin{equation}
m\leq s \quad \forall m
    \label{eq:ms}
\end{equation}

It is clear then, that for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so
\begin{equation}
s-m= n\in \mathbb{N}
    \label{eq:int}
\end{equation}

Similarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at
\begin{equation}
m+s=n\in \mathbb{N}
    \label{eq:mpluss}
\end{equation}

Combining \eqref{eq:int} and \eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get

\begin{equation}
m+s+s-m=2s=n \in \mathbb{N} \rightarrow s=\frac{n}{2}
    \label{eq:proofofinteger}
\end{equation}
Since $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.

So, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.

*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng

*** TODO Spin statistics relation


** Configuration space framework

The above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.

Luckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows

1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles
2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space
3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange

It almost seems too easy.

Let's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).

Without any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be
\[\mathbb{R}^d \otimes \mathbb{R}^d\]

However, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.



We need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )

Let us call the set of diagonal points $\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\mathbf{R}=\frac{(\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\mathbf{r}=(\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2})$.


Then, for our configuration space looks like
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{R}^d \otimes \frac{\mathbb{R}^d  - \Delta }{Z_2}
    \label{eq:confspaceddim}
\end{equation}

=just blantantly copied=
In order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can "discard" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{\mathbb{R}^d -\Delta}{Z_2}
    \label{eq:S}
\end{equation}

Before showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....

*** 3D
Let's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\Delta$, which for $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_1 -\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).

[[./media/3dexchange.png]]
#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed

#+label: fig:2dexchange


=Copying again=

An exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be "looping it around" the sphere (path C).

What is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.

Now we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so

\begin{equation}
\alpha^2=+1 \rightarrow \alpha = \pm 1
    \label{eq:doubleexchange}
\end{equation}

Thus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.


*** 2D

Let us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.

[[./media/2dexchange.png]]
#+caption: 2D exchange
#+attr_latex: scale=0.75
#+label: fig:2dexchange

We make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.

However, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the "string" cannot collapse to single point in principle.

Therefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\alpha$ has no effect on $|\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as

\begin{equation}
\alpha = e^{i\theta}
    \label{eq:phasephase}
\end{equation}




*** Connection to the Braid group

The above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way? The answer lies in a theorem????

Quantum statistics of a particle are the 1D representation of the [[file:20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org][First homotopy group pi_1]]/[[file:20210218153905-fundamental_group.org][fundamental group]] of the configuration space.

(Why are the QS that? Is this a theorem? If so, when does it apply?)



*** The relation between phase and connectedness of a space


For $d=2$ the fundamental group is the Braid group.

The 1D rep of the braid group is $e^{i\theta} \quad \theta\in[0,2\pi]$


* Critique

The main crux of my critique lies in the (in my eyes) unnecessary assumption that the quantum statistics of a particle can /only/ be determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space. While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.

However, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[file:20210330165632-problems_with_the_dn_model.org][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.



The order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:
1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)
2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/
3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics
4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space
5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space


Now, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.

Specifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.

The other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure

1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected
2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths
3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group
4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\theta}$
5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/


** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation

The problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.

[[file:20210405144616-eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]


* Brief critique summary

** Leng says: "Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness"

** Shech says: "We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA. Then anyons in the FQHE show that something is real but not cannot be approximately instantiated, namely 2D space".
pp 1977
"The fundamental group of approximately 2D is the same as that of 3D, namely $S_n$." "For anyons, we need fundamental group to be $B_n$, and /this can only occur in exactly 2D/."
"Yet, physical systems are not exactly 2D."
"Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system 'approximately instantiates' the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics."

In short: YOU CANNOT HAVE **BRAID GROUP STRUCTURE* IN 3D.

I say: YES YOU CAN, IF YOU BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH.

** I say:

*** That's not a great argument because the explanation we get from the anyon case/how Shech defines it is not strong enough to factor into the EIA

*** Moreover: This /is/ / can be seen as a case of approximate instantiation!

I aim to show that the Shech's claim that "it cannot be said that a physical system approximately instantiates the braid group structure" is false, and we can indeed say that a physical system can approximate such things, just not in the way that Shech thinks about it. The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.

Instead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.

With "finding an alternative route", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.
1. Bob takes anti-conception pills
2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant
C. Bob does not become pregnant.

While we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as "Bob does not have a uterus" and "If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as "If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.

So, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more "approximate" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with "observing the phase", which reeks of the "ad-hoc" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)

=garbo=
Next, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the "mini-explanation". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group
E. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$
L. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...
C. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\theta}$
(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. "The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\theta}$", "The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))
=garbo=

...

The most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:

We see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest

* Checklist

To show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*

** Options

*** Particles have nonzero size

In these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.

*** Not ALL paths

While the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.


*** Winding can be something different?
The main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.






* Junk

Startingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.

However, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered "approximately instantiated" in the Nortonian sense.

We just need to find a different path to "fit in" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either
1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space
2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??
3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well
4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way
5. Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have
6. 1D rep is approximate. I don't see how this would work.
7. Equivalence between spin is approximate, in the sense that there is some other physical mechanism which causes the phase to be such which does not rely on the above, such as the Berry phase calculation.


So, which of these is the most likely canditate for approximate instantiation?
