# Determinant

The determinant of a matrix $A$ is a scalar value of a function of the elements of the matrix.

## 2x2

For a $2x2$ matrix $A= \Big(\begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix}\Big)$, the determinant is

## 3x3

For a $3x3$ matrix things are a little more complicated, then it's

## General

annoying

# Properties

The determinant says a lot about the "structure" of the matrix, and is used in computing its [[Eigenvalues]]
