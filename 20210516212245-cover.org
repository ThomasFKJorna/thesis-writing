* Cover

A *cover* $C$ of a space $X$ is a [[file:20210403183001-covering_space.org][Covering space]] together with a [[file:20210403182527-covering_map.org][Covering map]] such that (roughly) there is a map from each one or more points in $C$ to every point $X$.

A cover has to be  [[file:20210505161024-surjective_onto.org][Surjective / Onto]], but is in general not injective, because covers usually have more than one point that map onto the same point in $X$.

The standard example is the spiral covering the circle: each point in the circle can be identified by infinitely many points in the spiral. You can imagine the spiral /unwinding/ from the circle.
