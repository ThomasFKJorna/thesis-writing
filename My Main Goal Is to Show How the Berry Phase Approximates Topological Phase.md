# My main goal is to show how the Berry phase approximates topological phase

# The main goal of my case study on FQHE is to show that the Berry phase can approximate the topological phase

In my chapter [[FQHE or anyon chapter|Structure FQHE/anyon chapter]], I am talking a lot of bullshit, which makes me forget my main goal:
Show how to approximate the [[The configuration space explanation of anyons]] using the  [[Geometric Phase]]/[[Berry phase]].

By approximate I mean this in Norton's sense [[Idealization vs Approximation]]: show how  taking increasing or decreasing some property gets us closer and closer to the topological phase calculation, in a smooth fashion.

This can be done in two ways: show how to calculate the phase, or show that the space is approximately simply connected. The latter is much more difficult.

# Entry points

As I think about it now, I need to figure out how [[Monodromy is an infinite idealization of holonomy]]
