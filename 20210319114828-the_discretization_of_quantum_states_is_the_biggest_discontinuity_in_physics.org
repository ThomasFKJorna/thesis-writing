#+title: The Discretization of Quantum States is the biggest discontinuity in physics
#+roam_tags: "functional analysis" central idealizations

I talk about a lot of things that are difficult to grasp and are possibly the result of too enthousiastic employment of infinite idealizations, but the discretization of quantum states has got to be the most egregious example of this.

I think that either no state is discretized, or they secretely all are. No ifs ands or buts about it.
