* Derivation of Landau Levels for QHE

The [[file:20210219125155-the_fractional_quantum_hall_effect_fqhe.org][the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]] and the [[file:20210219125447-the_integer_quantum_hall_effect_iqhe.org][the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]]'s energy levels are derived as follows (roughly)

Start with the [[file:20210223155459-general_hamiltonian_for_a_free_particle_in_a_magnetic_field.org][general Hamiltonian for a free particle in a magnetic field]]

\[H=\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}+e\mathbf{\hat{A}})^2\]

where $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{A}$ are of course the [[file:20210223160326-quantum_operators.org][quantum operators]] of momentum and the Gauge field respectively.

Since the particles in the Hall effect are restricted to lie in a plane  $\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$.
Since the magnetic field is constant and perpendicular to the plane  $\nabla\times \mathbf{\vec{A}}=B\mathbf{\hat{z}}$

From this we derive the [[file:20210223160541-canonical_commutation_relation.org][canonical commutation relation]]
\[[\hat{x_i},\hat{p_j}]=i\hbar\delta_{ij}\]
