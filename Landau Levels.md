# Landau Levels

Landau levels are the energy levels which arise when an otherwise free particle is subjected to a (strong?) magnetic field.

Landau levels are derived from the [[general Lagrangian for free particles in a magnetic field|general Lagrangian for free particles in a magnetic field.]] For a particle with charge $-e$ and mass $m$ moving in a background magnetic field  $\mathbf{B}=\nabla\times A$ the Lagrangian is$L=1/2m\dot{\mathbf{x}}^2-e\dot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot \mathbf{A}$

They are roughly$E_n=\hbar\omega_B(n+1/2)\quad n\in\mathbb{N} \quad \omega_B=eB/m$

The derivation is something like this [[derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]

Landau levels give rise to wavefunctions of the form (see [[derivation of landau level wavefunctions]] )

Furtermore, [[Landau states have a large degeneracy]]

Landau levels are very different in an electric field, [[Landau levels in an electric field]]
