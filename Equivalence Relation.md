# Equivalence Relation

## Munkres

An **equivalence relation** on a set $A$ is a [[Relation]] $C$ on $A$ such that

1) (Reflexivity) $\forall x\in A\quad C(x,x)$ (for all x in A, x stands in relation C to x)
2) (Symmetry) $C(x,y) \rightarrow C(y,x)$
3) (Transitivity) $C(x,y) \land C(y,z) \rightarrow C(x,z)$

Equivalence relations are often noted as $\~$, such that $x\~y$
