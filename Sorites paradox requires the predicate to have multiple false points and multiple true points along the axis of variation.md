The [[Sorites Paradox]] is about a vague transition point existing between two statements about something depending on a variation in *quantity*, e.g. when does a person start being tall between growing from 1m to 2m? If people were only tall at 2m, and could never get taller than that, we wouldnâ€™t have the paradox because there is no dispute or conflicting intuitions about where the transition point is.

Similarly, if there is a clear transition point, there is no paradox. This can happen either because the property is formulated separately from us forming intuitions about it, such as a tornado being category F5 on the Fujita scale if winds of > 419km/h are observed, or because there is a natural cutoff point, such as a person being *too tall* to be able to pass through a door without crouching. In both these cases there is a continuum, there are multiple points where the predicate is false and multiple points where the predicate is true, but there *is* a line to draw, such that the second premise of the inductive Sorites ($\neg \exists N\in\mathbb{N} \quad \neg P(N) \wedge P(N+1)$) is not true. Thus, no paradox.
