* Monodromy is an infinite idealization of holonomy

[[file:20210513123625-monodromy.org][Monodromy]], the thing that happens when 'something' (like a vector) travels around a singularity, can be seen as an [[file:20201219152020-infinite_idealizations.org][infinite idealization]] of what happens to the [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy]] of that things traveling the same path when the curvature of a surface gets flatter (into a singularity)

The main example I have here is that of [[file:20210513124828-limit_of_the_cone_holonomy.org][Limit of the cone holonomy]]
