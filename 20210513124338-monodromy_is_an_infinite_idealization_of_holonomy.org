* Monodromy is an infinite idealization of holonomy

[[id:e5951430-da06-4482-a7d3-7ac17c718d65][Monodromy]], the thing that happens when 'something' (like a vector) travels around a singularity, can be seen as an [[id:4d1d4b14-fb53-41d2-bc0d-a1c197cc6df0][infinite idealization]] of what happens to the [[id:fd2450df-e046-4d9c-a350-2be198e7fd04][Holonomy]] of that things traveling the same path when the curvature of a surface gets flatter (into a singularity)

The main example I have here is that of [[id:f1273fc1-07d3-447d-98ee-b8d5b7debb70][Limit of the cone holonomy]]
