#+title: Approximate instantiation is used as an argument against Platonism
#+filetags: :literature:approximation:platonism:

cite:Leng2012 tries to argue against Platonism being a valid way to explicate infinite idealization by saying that mathematical structures can be approximately instantiated.

I think this is the right approach, but it has some pitfalls and can be criticized by pointing out that not all mathematical structures can be approximately instantiated, as cite:Shech2019 does (or at least tries to do) with anyons.
