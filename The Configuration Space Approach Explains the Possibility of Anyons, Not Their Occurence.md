# The configuration space approach explains the possibility of anyons, not their occurence

# The configuration space approach to quantum statistics does not (aim) to explain _when_ anyons _will_ occur, just that they can/have to occur in two dimensions.

I was very confused about the role of the use of the [[configuration space framework for identical particles]] for describing anyons/the quantum hall effect, as it felt superfluous when the _appearance_ of [[fractional quantum statistics]] in  [[the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]] is justified/calculated using the [[Berry Connection]], which has no real clear tie to the configuration space framework.

I now realize that the configuration space "explanation" is not used to justify (or perhaps even explain) the appearance of fractional statistics in the FQHE, but to explain [[anyons]] wholesale!

The result of the explanation is that, in 2D, you _have_ fractional statistics. It also seems to imply that _only_ in 2D can you have fractional statistics, by showing how you cannot have fractional statistics in 3D. With this I disagree, but not with the claim that in 2D there will be  fractional statistics, and this is good to remember.
