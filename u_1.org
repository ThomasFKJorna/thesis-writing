* U(1)

The unitary group $U(1)$ is the group of unit ($|z|^2=1$) complex numbers together with ordinary complex number multiplication.

The elements of a group $U(x)$ have to be [[file:unitarity.org][Unitary]], that is $U^\dagger U=I$. Since this is $U(1)$ and we are dealing with scalars, this is the same as saying $\bar{z}z=1$.

This group is [[file:isomorphism.org][Isomorphic]] to [[file:so_2.org][SO(2)]] and thus describes rotations in the 2D plane.
