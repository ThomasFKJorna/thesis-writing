* U(1)

The unitary group $U(1)$ is the group of unit ($|z|^2=1$) complex numbers together with ordinary complex number multiplication.

The elements of a group $U(x)$ have to be [[id:552da469-86ec-401c-9125-5aa40eb89fcf][Unitary]], that is $U^\dagger U=I$. Since this is $U(1)$ and we are dealing with scalars, this is the same as saying $\bar{z}z=1$.

This group is [[id:79410b7f-6634-4010-96cd-9d2c81a4cd6c][Isomorphic]] to [[id:5a40714c-32b5-4277-b737-6a7c3a18e612][SO(2)]] and thus describes rotations in the 2D plane.
