Landau states have a large [[Degeneracy|degeneracy]] i.e. lots of states with different quantum numbers share the same energy [[eigenstate]].

We can quantify this as

$$
\mathcal{N} = \frac{AB}{\phi_0} \text{ where } A=\text{ area   and } \phi_0=\frac{2\pi\hbar}{e}
$$

$\phi_0$ is the [[quantum of flux]]
