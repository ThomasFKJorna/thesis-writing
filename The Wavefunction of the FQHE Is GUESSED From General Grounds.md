# The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds

# The Laughlin Wavefunction is guessed from general grounds

[[The Laughlin Wavefunction]] is just guessed for the FQHE $\approx10^{11}$ and was pretty close.

However, the guess, is not "just a guess", it is based on the following considerations:

- [[Every QH WF must have the form f-z(z1...zn)exp(-sum|zi|2)|Every QH WF must have the form fz(z1...zn)exp(-sum|zi|2)]]
- [[Every QH WF must be antisymmetric]]
- It has to fit a specific toy model

What's more, the LWF is not even that good of an approximation, instead it is the WF of a fake Hamiltonian.
