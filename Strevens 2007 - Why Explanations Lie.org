** I believe that idealization has the power to make an explanation better, more enlightening, a greater contribution to scientific understanding not only as grasped by mere mortal minds, but in the abstract. The aim of this paper is to reconcile these two apparently inconsistent faiths,

1. Difference makers for the explanatory target, which for a perfect model is ideal to the canonical model.
2. Idealizations: false claims that point to things that do not make a difference.

*** In short: difference makers and explicit non-difference makers.

** 1. An idealizing explanation is always better than its veridical counterpart,

*** It's better because the veridical counterpart claims things are difference makers when they're not. This is then completely based on difference making being the measure of idealization, which is problematic see cite:DeBianchi2016
** 2. An idealizing explanation is as good in one important sense as the corresponding canonical explanation

** Third, in explanatory models in population biology, infinite populations are assumed. The effect of this assumption is to set the expected rate of genetic drift to zero. What such a model says is that drift, though present, made no difference to the feature of the gene pool to be explained, say, the extinction of an inferior trait.
