* Continuous at a point

Let X and Y be [[file:20210403182645-topological_space.org][Topological space]]s and $f: X \rightarrow Y$. If for a point $x \in X$ and each [[file:20210505175610-neighborhood.org][Neighborhood]] $V$ of $f(x)$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)\subset V$, then $f$ is said to be *continuous at the point* $x$.

If $f$ is continuous at all points $x \in X$, $f$ is said to be [[file:20210505163129-continuity_function.org][continuous]].
