# Quasi-things Have Charge e/m

# Quasi-holes/particles carry charge e/m

## Intuition

This can be "intuited" by looking at the WF of the hole ([[where does the hole WF come from?]])

or, more generally, the WF of many holes

We note that if $M=m$, the WF will simply look like

If we squint our eyes and look at  as another electron, then this would simply be the N+1 LWF. But it's not,  is the absence of an electron. Since $m$ \$\$s make one 'electron', it's reasonable to assume that one  has charge $q=e\m$.

## Berry Connection

The above "proof" is rather shoddy. However, we can make a more educated guess by looking using the [[Berry Connection]]

However, this is too difficult to calculate, so we need to

[[Screening Allows us to Calculate the Berry Connection]]

which ends up being

...

Tada we get the right answer
