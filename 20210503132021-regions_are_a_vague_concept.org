* What a "spacetime region" is is vague

This is relevant for cite:Dougherty2020b 's claim that the topological explanation of the AB effect just requires a "region" of non-multiply connectedness, not a whole configuration space.
This seems kind of suspicious, as what a region is is kind of vague, so I don't think we can definitely say whether a path goes through it or not.
