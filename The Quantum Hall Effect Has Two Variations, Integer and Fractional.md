# the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional

The Quantum Hall Effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at multiples of the [[quantum of resistance]] $R_H=h/(e^2*\nu)$  in the transversal and longitudinal resitances measured in the[[The classical Hall Effect is just an application of the Lorentz Force|classical hall effect]].

This can be observed in this graph.![](./media/fqhe.png)

The QHE has two variations, which occur for very different reasons.

# [[the Integer quantum hall effect (IQHE)]]

The integer quantum hall effect is the observation of plateaux and valleys at integer multiples of the quantum of resistance.

# [[the Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE)]]

The fractional quantum hall effect is the observation of similar, but usually more subtle plateaux and valleys at (simple) fractional multiples of the quantum of resistance.

# Differences

[[IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]

[[reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]
