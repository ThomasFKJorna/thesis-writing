* The QS of the exchange of two identical particles are determined by the 1D rep of the fundamental group of that exchange

The [[id:3cf8ff6c-0ff4-4597-814c-d1b81aeaad67][Quantum Statistics]] of the exchange of two identical particles are determined by the [[id:eadcc86c-506d-4bd2-8922-61de2f301806][1D Representation of a Group]]  of the [[id:a07166f2-4a5c-40e6-a312-bc04b1b3d97e][fundamental group]] of said exchange.
