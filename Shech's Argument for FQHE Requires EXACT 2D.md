# Shech's argument for FQHE Requires EXACT 2D

# Shech's argument (as I see it) for why the FQHE (or more specifically the observation of FQ stats) requires the configuration space of electrons to be exactly 2D

1) FQHE shows/is compatible with/makes plausible the existence of [[fractional quantum statistics is the study of anyons]], i.e. the particles having an exchange factor of $e^{i2\pi\alpha}\quad \alpha\neq 0,1$
2) The quantum statistics of a particle is determined by the 1D representation of its [[fundamental group]]
3) The 1D representation of [[braid group]] is $e^{i2\pi\alpha}\quad\alpha\neq0,1$
4) The Braid group is the fundamental group _only_ of exchange in 2D space, as worldlines get entangled then.

$\therefore$ In order to explain anyons/FQHE, the configuration space of the electrons needs to be _exactly_ 2D, not small 3D.
