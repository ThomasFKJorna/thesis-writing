#+title: The practice/theory mixup problems of Infinite Idealization Occur in Science in General as Well

* The problems I identify with the infinite idealiztions in my case studies are not exclusive to those case studies: I think they occur in many if not all areas of scientific inquiry

Specifically, the problem of putting mathematics before the phenomena, such as taking FQ stats to be caused by the fundamental group of 2D space being the Braid Group, instead of looking at the phenomena first.
