#+title: The standard model is wrong because we observed neutrinon oscillation
#+filetags: physics

The easiest thing to bring against the standard model, after it not accounting for gravity, is simply to say: we observed neutrino oscillations, you cannot have neutrino oscillations in the SM, therefore it's an incomplete description at the very least.
