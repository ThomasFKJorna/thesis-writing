* Finding a way to approximately calculate anyons

For the next part of my thesis (as of 03-05-21) I am looking into how to approximately calculate the anyonic phase in the Fractional Quantum hall effect. For this, I want to look at explanations etc of the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]] in the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]], and I have a couple of differenent resoureces to do this.
