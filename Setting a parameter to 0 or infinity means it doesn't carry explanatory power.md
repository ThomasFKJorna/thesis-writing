# Setting a parameter to 0 or infinity means it doesn't carry explanatory power
This is a claim due to Strevens, eg 

> The deliberate falsification of certain details, then, is a way of communicating forcefully the idea that those details do no explanatory work (Strevens 2008, Chap. 8). The infinitely small size of molecules in an ideal gas tells us, for example, that intermolecular collisions (absent in an ideal gas) make no contribution to the explanation of Boyleâ€™s law, while the erasure of wave-like properties in the ray model of light tells us that those properties are irrelevant to the structure of caustics

I think this is bullocks, because often people care very much about these details and feel like they might even determine correctness. This might be the case in simple examples where the idealization is used more as a pedagogical aid, but this explanatory load-bearingness is way more apparent where the phenomenon is not adequately explained using other means like e.g. Strevens' "veridical model".

Examples are, of course, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, but also phase transitions or basically anything that actually tries to explain phenomena *directly* through the idealization/idealizing "method". No one sets populations to $\infty$ because they really want to explain the phenomena of populations not having genetic drift, because obviously that doesn't happen, nor is no one convinced when someone points to a large population and says "ahh kinda infinite tho right haha".

Obviously I do not know enough biology to know of situations where one would like to (or needs to) have $0$ genetic drift in order to explain anything, maybe there is! But even then, 0.002 genetic drift (science) is pretty similar to 0 genetic drift if you care about finite timescales, but simply connectedness is not pretty close to multiply connectedness.
