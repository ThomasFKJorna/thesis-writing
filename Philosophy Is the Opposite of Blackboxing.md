I really like blackboxing things: you don't need to know how things work if you just know what you need to put in and get out of them for them to be of use to you.[[Black-boxing in academia is very useful for creating predictions]]

This might also explain part of my difficulty with getting deep into philosophy, as philosophy is all about not accepting that certain input leads to certain output. Philosophers always want to ask: why, or what does that _really_ mean?

This is, of course, also the great strength of philosophy: it is about getting into the nittygritty of things and _really_ figuring out what lies underneath these claims. However, this rarely leads to clear solutions, which is why I always say that [[Philosophy is best used negatively or therapeutically]]
