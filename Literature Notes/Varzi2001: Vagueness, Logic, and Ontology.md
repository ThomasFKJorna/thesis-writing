# Varzi2001: Vagueness, Logic, and Ontology

# Vagueness, Logic, and Ontology

# Key takeways

## Main argument: supervaluationism is good

Varzi argues for [[Supervaluationism]] as a way to understand vagueness, and claims that ontological/de re accounts of vagueness are insufficient and even bad.

Ontological is bad becuse:

1) "there is something bizarre in the idea that the imprecision of certain boundaries is to be explained away by the reference to an infinity of perfectly recise degrees of truth". i.e. it's weird that it would be 0.81 true that the Count of Monte Christo is hairy if we pluck 10,000 hairs.
2) "there is the emberassing pressuposiition that a point exists where one goes from full truth to partial truth, and from partial truth to full faalsehood." It's not clear when we stop believing that a person is hairy.
3) Vague object are weird. How do we designate vague objects precisely?
4) We give up classical logic
