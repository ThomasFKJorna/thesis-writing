> [!abstract]
> Robert Batterman and others have argued that certain idealizing explanations have an asymptotic form: they account for a state of affairs or behavior by showing that it emerges “in the limit”. Asymptotic idealizations are interesting in many ways, but is there anything special about them as idealizations? To understand their role in science, must we augment our philosophical theories of idealization? This paper uses simple examples of asymptotic idealization in population genetics to argue for an affirmative answer and proposes a general schema for asymptotic idealization, drawing on insights from Batterman’s treatment and from John Norton’s subsequent critique.

> *“This essay attempts to make a contribution to the topic by posing the following question: is there any interesting difference between the rules that govern idealization in such canonical non-infinitary cases as frictionless planes and ideal gases, on the one hand, and Batterman’s asymptotic cases, on the other?”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1714)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=2&annotation=Y9ZTF86P)
> *“These fictions are called (at least when deliberate rather than inadvertent) idealizations”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1714)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=2&annotation=T8TFBCVE)
> *“The deliberate falsification of certain details, then, is a way of communicating forcefully the idea that those details do no explanatory work (Strevens 2008, Chap. 8). The infinitely small size of molecules in an ideal gas tells us, for example, that intermolecular collisions (absent in an ideal gas) make no contribution to the explanation of Boyle’s law, while the erasure of wave-like properties in the ray model of light tells us that those properties are irrelevant to the structure of caustics”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1715)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=3&annotation=WT5LJZ9S) 

This seems like such a weird point to me, like surely if you have to make them 0 or infinite for the thing to work then surely they are quite relevant? Maybe in Norton's "good" case like the pill/cylinder this is true, but surely not in asymptotic cases? Maybe he does only want to apply this to "boring" idealizations.

> *“Because asymptotic idealization is characterized with reference to the process by which an idealized model is created—that is, some sort of limiting process—it will be illuminating to offer a procedural characterization of simple idealization too, identifying it not so much by the structure of the end product, a certain deliberately misrepresenting model, but by the way in which the structure is derived”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1715)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=3&annotation=JN92RVWG) 

Interesting because rarely are the methods of idealization discussed.

> *“The salient characteristic of a simple idealization, then, is that a simple operation, namely, a change in the parameters of the veridical model, creates a new, partly fictional model that continues to model and indeed to explain the target phenomenon”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=HA6DJ5NF)
> *“In asymptotic idealization, by contrast, a fiction is introduced by taking some sort of limit. Rather than setting a parameter to zero, for example, a limit is taken as that parameter approaches zero”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=F69JE7JY)
> *“You could create an ideal gas model by taking the limit of the veridical mode”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=ZN55HC6R) 

hehe

> *“but you would merely be showing off.”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=XL76TVAT)

> *“Asymptotic idealization is an interesting proposition, then, only in those cases where a simple substitution cannot be performed, which is to say only in those cases where a veridical model for mathematical reasons falls apart or otherwise behaves badly at the limiting value”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=Q28A5WHT) 

This is where I get the "interesting" label from

> *“Norton (2012) has recently argued, however, that in these “interesting” cases, an asymptotically derived structure cannot be regarded as a genuine explanatory model of the system in question. At best, such structures must be interpreted as mere aids to calculation”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=3GEQCD2F)
> *“All purported cases of asymptotic idealization, then, can either be achieved through a more straightforward simple idealization (in cases where the veridical model is well behaved for the idealized values of the parameters in question), or must fail altogether as attempts at asymptotic modeling (though they may have practical uses as mathematical devices)”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1716)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=4&annotation=7DAUCELD)

> *“What the deterministic models omit, then, is mutation and drift. Such models have purely pedagogical uses,”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1717)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=5&annotation=NH2VQA4K) 

He even admits it!

> *“In order to “idealize away” drift simply, what is wanted is a parameter in such a probability distribution that can be set to zero (or some other value) to obtain a deterministic process. But there is, in general, no such parameter. There is no simple idealization, then, that transforms a more realistic, hence stochastic, population genetics model (let alone a veridical model) into a deterministic model”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1718)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=6&annotation=XZQV94T8) 

This is indeed interesting, so properties of the model are not parameters of the model and aren't straightforwardly derived from it

> *“Drift cannot be set to zero directly, then, but it can zeroed indirectly by taking population size, another parameter in stochastic models, to be infinitely large”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1718)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=6&annotation=P7ESD6V9) 

Damn this guy is just repeating this over and over

> *“n an infinite population, probability mathematicians therefore turn to limiting frequencies. But a limiting frequency is defined only relative to an ordering of outcomes. Suppose that I have an infinitely big pile of As and an infinitely big pile of Bs. I can alternately take one from each pile and put them in an infinitely long sequence. That gives me a limiting frequency of one-half for the As. But I can equally well build an infinitely long sequence by taking two As for every one B, giving me a limiting frequency of two-thirds for the As. (There is no prospect of running short of As; there are infinitely many.) So the limiting frequency depends on how the objects in question are ordered in a sequence”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1721)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=9&annotation=SSAICDI2) 

Couldn't you just add an extra assumption that either species pair up randomly&nbsp; or in a predictable way, thus have an ordering and thus solve this?

> *“Consequently, the infinite population idealization cannot be treated as a simple idealization in which the population is set to infinity”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1721)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=9&annotation=XGABNUCK) 

Aha okay no so he claims it is an asymptotic idealization because it isn't a simple one: you don't just start at the infinite case and call it a day, you start at the finite case and then asymptote from there

> *“Consequently there is no infinitary model, merely a piece of infinitary mathematics that derives certain behaviors of a non-infinitary model. (This is why Norton says that in these cases “there are no infinite idealizations employed”: an infinite idealization by its very nature goes by way of an infinitary model.)”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1722)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=10&annotation=VTD4RYPT)
> *“Population geneticists do not use the deterministic theory as a mere pedagogical or calculating device, then; they use it to construct models that are explanatory in their own right”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1722)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=10&annotation=ZEQ6HHKW) 

But you just said so otherwise a few pages back!

> *“We must therefore embrace the third option presented above: the infinite population idealization is a genuine idealization, but not a simple idealization. It is an asymptotic idealization”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1723)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=11&annotation=FY4CGA9L)
> *“I now present an account of asymptotic idealization—conceived as a practice that sits alongside, but is distinct from, simple idealization—using the infinite population idealization as a paradigm. Simple idealization is achieved by a simple act of parameter substitution: the scientist takes the veridical model and alters the value of one or more parameters”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1723)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=11&annotation=EI6CASFT) 

My earlier hunch, then, was incorrect, and my old self was more correct: simple/asymptotic idealization is not about directly/indirectly setting the target parameter, but about immediately/gradually setting a parameter

> *“Non-idealized models Extrapolation models n = 25 n = 50 n = 100 ,,, ,,, Idealized model Extrapolation parameter n increasing without bound Limiting structure None Fig. 2 Asymptotic extrapolation. The idealized model is determined solely by (relatively) non-idealized models with finite values for the population size n. The construction does not require anything to occupy the top right corner—it does not require a stochastic model with infinite population size”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1725)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=13&annotation=HFMT2RUR) 

This is just exactly what norton says but instead of being like "nah fam that's cringe" Strevens' is like "based"Norton would just say "this is an approximation fam, you're just using the assertions not the model. Wonder why Strevens' thinks otherwise

> *“Look past the formality, however, and what’s there corresponds very closely to population geneticists’ actual, very straightforward reasoning from infinite populations to evolutionary determinism. It captures rather well, in other words, what’s meant when an expositor points to something like Fig. 1 and says: look, as the population increases, drift’s contribution to frequency dynamics decreases, and in the limit as the population goes infinite, drift disappears altogether and you get fully deterministic change in frequencies”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1726)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=14&annotation=SQCP365S) 

cringe, now youre back to using super basic examples! Where's Mr. Limiting frequency from a couple of pages ago? This example could be easily explained away by saying: "theyre just wrong"

> *“First, it is quite correct to observe that the sequence of extrapolation models is not sufficient in itself to determine a limiting structure and so an idealized model. Also required is what you might call an extrapolation space, a mathematical framework in which to define and compute the limit”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1726)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=14&annotation=4V52ALZR) 

This kind of argument will almost never work because the people using the idealizations don't care/know about when you can actually define these limits and the people who do know/care about them are little nerds

> *“. Asymptotic extrapolation works because the infinite parameter, population size, does not appear explicitly in an extrapolation model, which spells out frequencies but not absolute numbers of genes or organism”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1726)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=14&annotation=CYC3LPPA) 

It works because instead of making claims you just wiggle your eyebrows a lil and say "you know... 😉"

> *“. It is, nevertheless, possible to imagine a Nortonizing voice chiding: What is the point of such a convention? Why insist that population geneticists’ deterministic models falsely assert the population’s infinitude, rather than taking the alternative view that they say nothing about population size, or (a very similar view) that they represent populations of large but finite size? One rationale for insisting on the link to infinitude is simply to do justice to the way that population geneticists such as Gillespie talk”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1727)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=15&annotation=4R5NKJTP) 

Ah the ol' "i'm just taking what scientists say literally"-moral highground, classic. While I think I get why people do this, I hate it! We're not that different from the scientists! Ideally you'd see yourself as a scientist in the field just doing more thinking than theorizing/experimenting right?? This deferring to scientists authority seems kinda defeatist to me, kinda like "I'm sure they know what they're doing, otherwise why would they be doing it?"

> *“Asymptotic extrapolation from a realistic model requires: 1. An extrapolation parameter, that is, a parameter in the model which in the intended idealization goes to zero or infinity or some other extreme value, 2. A template for an extrapolation model, which is derived from the realistic model by assigning a fixed value to the extrapolation parameter and removing all representation of that parameter from the model while retaining the model’s ability to represent behavior relevant to the explanatory task, and 3. An extrapolation space, which provides the mathematical structure for finding the limiting form of the extrapolation models as the extrapolation parameter tends to the extreme value.”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1729)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=17&annotation=KUCBAWAX) 

in short: limit happens

> *“The idealized model is the limiting form of the extrapolation models.”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1729)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=17&annotation=M6K6G8NW)
> *“Yet population geneticists no more wrestle with this difficulty than they worry about the order-relativity of limiting frequencies. They have some way of making sense of the “infinity” talk that requires no high-level mathematical maneuvers.”* [(Strevens, 2019, p. 1730)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3T6DFSVS?page=18&annotation=3FFUNK8E) 

I think people should make it very clear at the start of a work where they attempt to lay down some sort of definition how normative they take this definition to be. It's very easy to take people to say "this is how it is" or "this is how you should use it", when they want to say "this is how people could be using it sensibly"
