# Why Explanations Lie: Idealization in Explanation

## Why?

## The explanatory use of causally inaccurate models is of special interest to an advocate of the causal approach to explanation.

## I believe that idealization has the power to make an explanation better, more enlightening, a greater contribution to scientific understanding not only as grasped by mere mortal minds, but in the abstract. The aim of this paper is to reconcile these two apparently inconsistent faiths,

## Idealizations, I will argue, convey explanatorily essential information, that is, information that must be grasped in order to understand perfectly the phenomena to be explained.

## Thus the unificationist account of idealization appears to fall through: our best idealizations seem sometimes not to result in the greatest degree of unification.

## To generalize the discussion of Boyleâ€™s law: the role of an idealization is to assert the explanatory irrelevance, that is, the failure to make a difference, of a salient causal factor.

## 1. It is evidently false.

## . The false claim fills out certain details left unspecified by the canonical explanatory model.

## 3. The details are filled out in a certain way: the relevant parameters are assigned a zero, an infinite, or some other default value.

## The content of an idealized model, then, can be divided into two parts

1) Difference makers for the explanatory target, which for a perfect model is ideal to the canonical model.
2) Idealizations: false claims that point to things that do not make a difference.

### In short: difference makers and explicit non-difference makers.

## 1. An idealizing explanation is always better than its veridical counterpart,

### It's better because the veridical counterpart claims things are difference makers when they're not. This is then completely based on difference making being the measure of idealization, which is problematic see [@DeBianchi2016]

## 2. An idealizing explanation is as good in one important sense as the corresponding canonical explanation

**\***

## Third, in explanatory models in population biology, infinite populations are assumed. The effect of this assumption is to set the expected rate of genetic drift to zero. What such a model says is that drift, though present, made no difference to the feature of the gene pool to be explained, say, the extinction of an inferior trait.
