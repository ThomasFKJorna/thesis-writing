# Gendler 2020: Thought Experiments Rethought - and Reperceived

> _How can the contemplation of an imaginary scenario provide one with new true beliefs about contingent matters, and, assuming that it can do so, how are those new beliefs justified?_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1152) This is the "hook" of the paper: let's just do epistemology on thought experiments, see where it will get us.

> _Nonetheless, there is a sharp divide among the participants that can be traced to the following questions: 1. Are the new beliefs that we form on the basis of the contemplation of imaginary scenarios actually formed as the result of inference from known premises to inductively or deductively implied conclusions? 2. To the extent that the new beliefs are not so formed, are they justified?_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1153) Is this a useful distinction?

> _Taken in full, both positions are extremely implausible:_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1153) I'm glad he doesn't say equally but man: Norton's view is not _that_ implausible is it

> _Rather, I will suggest, in the case of imaginary scenarios that evoke certain sorts of quasi-sensory intuitions, their contemplation may bring us to new beliefs about contingent features of the natural world that are produced not inferentially, but quasi-observationally; the presence of a mental image may play a crucial cognitive role in the formation of the belief in question._

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1154) Soooo, we create a mental model and "see" it play out in our minds, from which we can "observe" the outcomes and then in/de/abduce certain things? I wonder how much accepting this view depends on how your imagination works, and whether Norton has aphantasia or something

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1154) Wonder what he will do with this distinction, does not sound _that_ useful

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1155) Not something I would _necessarily_ associate with thought experiments, but interesting.

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1156) How does this involve a)? a) just says that in thought experiments yu reason about circumstances described at a greater level of specificity than the conclusion: what does that have to do with epistemology or inferential reasoning? It just says that you have stuff, you reason, and you have a conclusion.

> [!quote]
> _It seems plausible to endorse a view according to which the particularity of the scenarios involved in thought-experimental reasoning supplies some epistemic force, while also accepting that the regularities to which scientific thought-experimental reasoning gives us access are contingent features of the natural world_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1156) How does thinking that "the particularity of the scenarios involved supplies some epistemic force" lead to siding with Brown? Is it because Norton claims that the conclusion of your thought experiment should be the same as long as it's "an argument"? Rather than the particular setting of the thought experiment aloowing us some priviliged epistemic access to... something?

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1157)
Good example, because usually when we talk about "knowledge" it is about things we know directly and all we can infer from it.

If you here hooves in the distance, you don't _know_ whether it's zebras or horses.

Are there cases similar to this, where you don't know something, you think for a bit, and then you know? The obvious example is math, but this sounds like points for Norton if anything.

> _Four elephants, mentally arrayed them in the room, and tried to ascertain whether there was space for the four elephants within the confines of the room’s four walls. Of course, in many ways, the mental image you formed was unspecified:_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1157)
I think aphantasia is a good counter argument to this: surely people without this abilitiy could still do thought experiments? Just simple "what if" things could still work.

> [!quote]
> _you presumably invoked a mental image of the room (using memory), and—holding constant your affordance-based sense of its dimensions—evoked a quasiproprioceptive image of the experience of riding a bicycle in a space_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1157) Let us do a thought experiment ourselves of someone without this ability: this person could still perform this thought experiment if they made an estimate of how large the room was, how large an average elephant is, and do more of a Fermi-estimate of whether it is possible to ride an elephant there.

> _But is that really what happened? My inclination is to think not. Rather, what happened is that formed a judgment on the basis of your manipulation of your mental image, and—using that new information—went on to draw your conclusion about the more general statement for which you took it to be evidence._

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) I think it really depends on the person's mental faculties (that sounds mean) whether that is plausible or not.

> [!quote]
> _wouldn’t you proceed by putting the elephants into the room, and seeing whether they fit? Suppose I took away the third and fourth elephants before you managed to place them in the room. Would your imaginary continuation of the process you had begun really be a process of deductive reasoning?_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) Okay good point, I also doubt that someone would not be able to continue that, butttt maybe they did? The question of whether this "putting things in a thing and see if it fits" is "deductive reasoning" is interesting though, but I don't see how those are per se incompatible. Although, yes, you're not really deductively reasoning, even though it could be modeled as such.

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \\\\
Is the "elephant" example even a good thought experiment, comparable with Galileo's balls? One difference is that the new knowledge in this case is very similar to knowledge we already have: the question is not whether big things can sometimes fit into smaller things, but whether the things are bigger than the other. GBalls was about whether heavy things fall faster than slow things _in general_. Maybe a comparable thing would be the standard math problem of a train traveling by x km/s vs a train traveling by y km/s: which arrives earlier? Sure, given vague data (elephants, room) we need to do some more work to get to the conclusion, but it's not really _interesting_ because we could have easily figured it out with more data.

Of course, galileo could have just dropped some balls, but he did have some actual constraints (such as air resistance) and his conclusion is much more general.

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) Maybe the conclusion is: thought experiments are different things for different people? That is a bit boring.

> _Research by Roger Shepard and others has shown that judgments about topological similarity are generally made after engaging in the mental manipulation of an image: the greater the degree of rotation required to project one onto the other, the longer it takes to judge whether two figures are isomorphic_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \\\\
Interesting example about intuitive reasoning, but are they really _thought experiments?_ Or, to play nicely, should this be counted as performing a thought experiment? By their criteria it does, but maybe their criteria are not stringent enough?

One possible criteria: a thought experiment is an experiment you either cannot do or cannot generalize when done physically.

Then the topological similarity does sort of count, but I kind of struggle with congrueing mathematics and "experimenting" lol

> [!quote]
> _do we really want to say that the belief was formed by deductive or inductive reasoning_

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1160) Is imagining a scenario and then forming a belief from it really a thought experiment? I find this idea a bit too general, but don't have a convincing enough argument against it.

> [!quote]
> _As before, it’s hard to see why we would want to say that this new justified true belief (that the rotated image resembles Texas) was formed by inductive or deductive reasoning from known premises._

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1161) Decent point. The answer to "How do you infer that this image is Texas?" is not a step by step process. BUT: this is more saying something about "perception" than how a thought experiment works. I guess the one thing you can say is that the setup of\~ a thought experiment (if you could call this one) does have a lot of impact on the conclusions we draw from it.

> [!quote]
> _This belief is produced not inferentially, but quasi-observationally: the presence of the mental image plays a crucial cognitive role in its formation._

(Gendler, 2004, p. 1162) I think this point is really hard to disagree with: the imaginative component is very powerful, and what we are doing when we perform a thought experiment is much more akin to "intuiting" than "deducing".},
