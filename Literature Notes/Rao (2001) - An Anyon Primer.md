# An Anyon Primer

> [!abstract]
> In this set of lectures, we give a pedagogical introduction to the subject of anyons. We discuss 1) basic concepts in anyon physics, 2) quantum mechanics of two anyon systems, 3) statistical mechanics of many anyon systems, 4) mean field approach to many anyon systems and anyon superconductivity, 5) anyons in field theory and 6) anyons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). (Based on lectures delivered at the VII SERC school in High Energy Physics at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, January 1992 and at the I SERC school in Statistical Mechanics at Puri, February 1994.)
