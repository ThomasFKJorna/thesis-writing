# Kadanoff (2009) - More is the Same; Phase Transitions and Mean Field Theories

> [!abstract]
> This paper is the first in a series that will look at the theory of phase transitions from the perspectives of physics and the philosophy of science. The series will consider a group of related concepts derived from condensed matter and statistical physics. The key technical ideas go under the names of “singularity”, “order parameter”, “mean field theory”, “variational method”, “correlation length”, “universality class”, “scale changes”, and “renormalization”. The first four of these will be considered here.

> *“For example, the philosopher might wish to note that, strictly speaking, no phase transition can ever occur in a finite system. Thus, in some sense, phase transitions are not exactly embedded in the finite world but, rather, are products of the human imagination.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 778)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=2&annotation=XDLY3K6U)
> *“superconductors. I could go on and on. The point is that humankind has, in part, understood these different manifestations of matter, manifestations that go under the name “thermodynamic phases”.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 778)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=2&annotation=EUGQ5X8N)
> *“But, we define only two fundamentally different kinds of phase transitions:”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 779)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=3&annotation=CNEG8AHA)
> *“First order phase transitions are ones in which basic thermodynamic quantities like the number of particles per unit volume or the magnetization show a sudden jump as a function of temperature or pressure or other thermodynamic characteristi”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 779)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=3&annotation=TNRPAW9P)
> *“Continuous transitions are those in which some sudden changes occur, but these changes are more gentle than a discontinuous jump in the basic variables.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 779)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=3&annotation=T8NP3687)

> *“σ , upon each site-labeled by r of a simple lattice. (See Fig. 3.) Each spin variable takes on values plus or minus one to represent the possible directions that might be taken by a particular component of a real spin upon a real atom. So the system has been reduced to a set of variables, σr, each taking on one of two possible values.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 781)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=5&annotation=45RMF7X4)
> *“a phase transition as a point of singularity, i.e. sudden change”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 782)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=6&annotation=7HSNBUNR)
> *“A phase transition occurs at points in the phase diagram where the free energy is a singular function of the thermodynamic variables within it.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 782)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=6&annotation=YPX6XAEH)
> *“By this argument the Ising model, as we have described it, can have no phase transitions. Further, there cannot be any phase transition in any finite system described by the Ising model or indeed any statistical system with everything in it being finite.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 782)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=6&annotation=P2LPCPQS)
> *“The hole can be seen by using continuity arguments, and equally well from modern numerical studies that show the nature of the “discontinuous jump”.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 782)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=6&annotation=2BFQ3AD2)
> *“If these systems must be infinite, then the phase transition is likely to be characterized by long-ranged order within the system, and that order must be important in the far reaches of the system. Any theory of phase transitions that does not include ordering at infinity is likely to be inadequate.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 782)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=6&annotation=VKJP9WRS)
> *“As the number of lattice sites gets larger the variation in the magnetization will get steeper, until at a very large number of sites the transition from positive values of 〈σ 〉 to negative ones will become so steep that the casual observer might say that it has occurred suddenly. The astute observer will look more closely, see that there is a very steep rise, and perhaps conclude that the discontinuous jump only occurs in the infinite system”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 783)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=7&annotation=EV99XVCX)
> *“By this argument whenever a material shows one behavior in one region of a phase diagram, and another, qualitatively different, behavior in a different region then somewhere in between there must be a phase transition. The fact that you can walk on ice but not on liquid water strongly suggests that in between one should find a phase transition. Thus, we can infer that the melting of ice is indeed a phase transition”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 783)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=7&annotation=7BB9C9GR)
> *“The answer is that the simplicity enables one to formulate and test important qualitative questions such as “in what situations might it be possible to have a phase transition?” The answer to this question is not obvious and can be best approached through the simplest model that does display the phase transition”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 784)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=8&annotation=UNC468TN)
> *“This strategy is made rewarding by a characteristic of physical systems called “universality”, in that many systems may show the very same qualitative features, and sometimes even the same quantitative ones”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 784)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=8&annotation=CV89M5Y9)
> *“This brings us to the next issue: “Are phase transitions real?” That question bears upon the source of physical concepts. Since a phase transition only happens in an infinite system, we cannot say that any phase transitions actually occur in the finite objects that appear in our world. Instead, we must conclude that phase transitions and the definitions of different thermodynamic phases are the result of a process of extrapolating the “real” behavior of a theory of large bodies, to its infinite conclusion [22, 23]. Indeed, Nature gives us no pure thermodynamic phases but only real objects displaying their own complex and messy behavior. This extrapolation and simplifying process necessary to define thermodynamic phases suggests that at least this part of theoretical physics is not a simple result of the direct examination of Nature, but rather it is a result of the human imagination applied to an extrapolation of that examination. In this way, the Ising model helps us see more clearly what our imagination has produced. No addition of bells, whistles, or additional complicating features could, for this purpose, improve upon the bare simplicity of the Ising model. The point is not to give an accurate description of a particular ferromagnet, but rather to give a barebones description from which one can infer general features of a ferromagnet.”* [(Kadanoff, 2009, p. 784)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJSA4MB6?page=8&annotation=UQD2IGLE)
