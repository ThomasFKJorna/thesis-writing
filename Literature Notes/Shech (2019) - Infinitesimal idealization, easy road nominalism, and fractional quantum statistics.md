# Shech (2019) - Infinitesimal idealization, easy road nominalism, and fractional quantum statistics

> [!abstract]
> It has been recently debated whether there exists a so-called “easy road” to nominalism. In this essay, I attempt to fill a lacuna in the debate by making a connection with the literature on infinite and infinitesimal idealization in science through an example from mathematical physics that has been largely ignored by philosophers. Specifically, by appealing to John Norton’s distinction between idealization and approximation, I argue that the phenomena of fractional quantum statistics bears negatively on Mary Leng’s proposed path to easy road nominalism, thereby partially defending Mark Colyvan’s claim that there is no easy road to nominalism.

## Outline
### 1: Intro
Lot of debate about [[Easy road nominalism]], the claim that we can be nominalists about math without showing that we can do science without math ([[Hard road nominalism]]).

Shech wants to explore whether [[Nominalist Scientific Realism]] can provide a good counter argument.

A good argument against platonism should be weighed against the [[Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA)]].

### 2: Approximate instantiation
Shech shows how Leng's [[Nominalist Scientific Realism]] depends on the "approximate instantiation" of mathematical models in the physical world.

The problem: how to be realist about science (cool, based) while not being platonists (cringe)? 
Leng says: physical structures can [[approximate instantiation|approximately instantiate]] mathematical structures.

### 3: What is approximate instantiation?
Shech thinks Leng is too vague about what approximation means and proposes using [[Norton (2012) - Approximation and idealization Why the difference matters]] in order to make clear what she means.
He concludes that "a physical structure instantiates a mathematical model if it approximates it in the Norton sense."

### 4. ESR does not always work
Shech aims to show that Leng's approximate instantiation approach does not always work because there are situations in which we cannot say that some mathematical structure is approximately instantiated, e.g. in the case of anyons.

- [ ] Go into slightly more depth summarizing Shech's argument here

### 5. Idealization is common and other objections
Shech claims that these sorts of idealizations are common and counters three objections.

#### "If no AI occurs, then the theory is wrong"
Shech claims that philosophers of science should not claim that explanations put forth by physicists are wrong because they "conflict with ones favorite account of scientific explanation." If the scientists think it's a good explanation, it is.

The claims he uses are
1. Philosophers of science should not overrule scientists' accounts of explanation (i disagree)
2. You can't weasel your way out of needing *exact* 2d because you do need it and "dynamic 2d" is not 2d because of quantum fluctuations.
3. Also you can't say "nooo you can't make appeal to nonconverging idealizations" because you shuoldnt speculate 

#### "You are nitpicky and biased"
To the claim that the example of anyons is an anomaly, Shech says "no it's not".
Look phase transitions, etc.

#### "This cannot even explain in the first place because explanations need to make a difference."
Here Shech is basically arguing against @Baron2016, who claims that explaining can be captured in terms of "difference making."

Shech responds with
> if by “difference maker” Baron (2016) means something that can make a causal difference to the occurrence of a concrete physical phenomenon, then no abstract object (mathematical or idealized) whatsoever can ever satisfy the role of difference maker. However, if by “difference maker” we mean making a difference to the mathematical derivation which is an essential ingredient in the explanatory story told by our best sciences of a some concrete physical phenomenon, then both the number of H2O molecules and the dimensionality of a system are difference makers for phase transitions and fractional statistics, respectively.

## 1 Introduction[ ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=1)

> *“The overarching goal of this essay is to draw attention to some interesting connections between the literature on infinite and infinitesimal idealizations in science and issues in philosophy of mathematics such as mathematical indispensability and explanation”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1963)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=1)
> *“I first introduce Leng’s (2005, 2010, 2012) approach to easy road nominalism in Sect. 2 and show how it depends on the idea that a physical system can “approximately instantiate” mathematical structure where a mathematical explanation is at hand.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1965)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=3)
> *“Since Leng (2005, 2010, 2012) does not does explicate what is meant by “approximate instantiation,” I critically consider a possible way of expounding on her account via Norton’s (2012) well-received distinction between approximations and idealizations in Sect. 3: physical structure can approximately instantiate mathematical structure if the latter can be characterized as an approximation (in Norton’s sense) of the former.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1965)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=3)
> *“I present the case study of the anyons and fractional statistics along with the standard explanatory story found in the physics literature in Sect. 4 as an example of an indispensable mathematical explanation wherein there is no sense in”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1965)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=3) ... *“which the mathematical structure appealed to in order to explain fractional statistics is “approximately instantiated” in a physical system”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1966)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=4)
> *“Section 5 explains that cases such as fractional statistics are a common feature of our best physical theories and entertains three nominalist objections. My hope is that it will be clear from my discussion of fractional statistics and essential, infinite/infinitesimal idealizations that the study of such examples may greatly inform the debate on easy road nominalism and, more generally, the cogency of mathematical explanations.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1966)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=4)
> *“I conclude the paper with a short summary in Sect. 6 (and have added an “Appendix” at the end of the paper with technical details).”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1966)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=4)


## 2 Leng’s easy road nominalism[ ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=4)

> *“3 Approximation, idealization, and approximate instantiation”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1967)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=5)

> *“I am thus suggesting a kind of condition of adequacy on any Leng-type NSR account of a phenomenon appearing in some physical target system, which appeals to the notion of “approximate instantiation:” 
> Condition of Adequacy: Approximate instantiation can adequately justify an NRS account of a phenomenon appearing in a physical target system just in case there is a match between the relevant properties of the limit system (used to represent/model the target system) and the corresponding limit properties.17”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1969)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=7) 

Good definition for approximate instantiation.


> *“. It is only at the limit that the property of non-simply connectedness and nontrivial fundamental group arises. Connectedness is a binary topological property. Either the space is connected or it is not; there is no intermediate.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1972)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=10)


## 4 Easy road nominalism meets anyons[ ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=11)

> *“However, it turns out that in two dimensions the configuration space framework allows the exchange phase to take on any value.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1974)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=12)

> *“The standard story found in the physics literature is that it is in virtue of the fact that the fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in two dimensions is the braid group BN”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1975)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=13)

> *“Connecting with Leng’s (2010, 2012) notion of structural explanation we may say that (a) physical FQHE systems instantiated the structure corresponding to the configuration space of identical particles in two-dimensions (since there is little to no motion in the third spatial direction), and that (b) the existence of fractional statistics is a consequence of two facts: (1) the phase factor characterizing quantum statistics is the one-dimensional unitary representation of the fundamental group of a system’s configuration space and (2) in two dimensions the fundamental group is the braid group. However, and importantly, it is no longer clear that we can dispense with reifying the explanatory mathematical structure. The reason is that, although FQHE systems are approximately two-dimensional and seem to manifest behavior consistent with fractional statistics, still, it is not the case that the mathematical structure is “approximately instantiated” as Leng’s account necessitates. The fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in approximately two dimensions is the same as that of three dimensions, the permutation group SN . In order to allow for fractional statistics we need the fundamental group to be the braid group BN , and this can only occur in exactly two dimensions. Yet, physical systems are not exactly two-dimensional. Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system “approximately instantiates” the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1977)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=15)

> *“The fundamental group of the configuration space of identical particles in approximately two dimensions is the same as that of three dimensions, the permutation group SN .

S”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1977)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=15)

> *“Given that we know of cases where the success of a theory is not due to the actual existence of the ideal objects it hypothesizes, but rather due to the way in which these convenient “myths” allow us to represent some facts about real objects, is this not enough to throw into question the claim that the existence of ideal continuous fluids should be considered as confirmed by the success of fluid dynamics?”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1978)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=16)

> *“It seems to me that, unless one can successfully apply a developed NSR account, such as the expounded version of Leng’s approach, then the default answers to such questions—in the context of the case study of anyons and fractional statistics that I consider—ought to be “no.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1978)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=16)


## 5 Nominalistic objections[ ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=16)

> *“But why do we need the system to be exactly, dynamically two-dimensional and not just two-dimensional “for all practical purposes?”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1980)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=18)

> *“anyons arise when the fundamental group of the configuration space is the braid group and this happens only for two-dimensions: π1 (Q) = BN for d = 2. For a three-dimensional system that is only effectively two-dimensional the fundamental group is the symmetry group, i.e., π1 (Q) = SN for d = 3, and thus the mathematical structure is not rich enough to give rise to anyons and fractional statistics.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1980)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=18)

> *“But the probability that one will find a particle in the third dimension in physical space in systems that manifest the FQHE is not zero (although it is extremely low, e.g., on the order of 10−44”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1980)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=18)

> *“it has been argued that fractional statistics are the results of an AB effect-type phase picked up by the particles when they circle each other”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1982)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=20)

> *“the problem is exacerbated in the context of anyons and fractional statistics since, as emphasized above, the explanatory story of the emergence of anyons told in Sect. 4.1 shows that fractional statistics arise from the topological braid group structure.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1982)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=20)

> *“both Laughlin (1983) and Arovas et al. (1984) assume that they are working with a exactly two-dimensional system, and in such systems we know that anyons can emerge.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1982)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=20)

> *“My suggestion then is that proponents of the easy road nominalism debate, and the debate on mathematical explanation, may benefit from attending to examples of essential, infinite/infinitesimal idealization science. E”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1985)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=23)

> *“Instead, since the particles are identical, configurations that differ only by a permutation of particles ought to correspond to the same physical state.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)

> *“. In the context of the general case, this corresponds to considering the quotient (or identification) space that one attains by diving out the permutation group SN : Q = Rd SN .”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)

> *“. The exclusion of the diagonal point implies that the space in not simply connected and I denote this new configuration space with ̃ Q.”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)

> *“In order to extend ordinary QM to multiply connected regions we need to appeal the topological notion of a universal covering space Q of ̃ Q”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)

> *“we will want this quantity to be projectable down to ̃ Q”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)

> *“q = π (q)”* [(Shech, 2019, p. 1986)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJ6ZIURN?page=24)
