* Metric

A *metric*, as physicists use it, is something, usually a matrix, which rather globally indicates how distances are to measured.

It differs from the metric in [[file:20210416111039-metric_space.org][Metric Space]], as it by itself does not indicate distance. It needs to be combined with a distance function, usually [[file:proper_time.org][Proper time]]
