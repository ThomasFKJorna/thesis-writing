* Equivalence Relation

** Munkres

An *equivalence relation* on a set $A$ is a [[file:20210505152606-relation.org][Relation]] $C$ on $A$ such that
1. (Reflexivity) $\forall x\in A\quad C(x,x)$ (for all x in A, x stands in relation C to x)
2. (Symmetry) $C(x,y) \rightarrow C(y,x)$
3. (Transitivity) $C(x,y) \land C(y,z) \rightarrow C(x,z)$

Equivalence relations are often noted as $\~$, such that $x\~y$
