If this is so, I can attack Shech's argument in two ways

1. I can show that he presupposes that symmetries are ontological in some way.
   From here I can either show that this begs the question, as whether or not things such as mathematical structures can be ontological is the very thing under discussion, or
2. I can show that this leads to undesirable commitments.
   This might be more difficult however, as one of the most obvious undesirable commitments would be a rampant realism, but that is not so undesirable as that is, again, the thing in question.
