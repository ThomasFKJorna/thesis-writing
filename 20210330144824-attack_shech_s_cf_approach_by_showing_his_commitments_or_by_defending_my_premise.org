#+title: Attack Shech's CF approach  by showing his commitments, or by defending my premise
#+filetags: anyons

* I can either attack cite:Shech2019   [[id:e6303312-f094-4dd9-9d74-568bd31a89ea][The configuration space explanation of anyons]] by showing that he has a certain commitment that he's not saying, or by convincing the reader that my way of viewing the problem is better

#+transclude: t
[[id:625136f8-9529-46ab-9f18-204fcca628df][The configuration space explanation approach requires a certain stance on the ontology of symmetries]]

If this is so, I can attack Shech's argument in two ways

1. I can show that he presupposes that symmetries are ontological in some way.
   From here I can either show that this begs the question, as whether or not things such as mathematical structures can be ontological is the very thing under discussion, or
2. I can show that this leads to undesirable commitments.
   This might be more difficult however, as one of the most obvious undesirable commitments would be a rampant realism, but that is not so undesirable as that is, again, the thing in question.
