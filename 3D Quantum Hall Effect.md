In addition to the general [[the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional|quantum hall effect,]] which is, alledgedly, a completely 2D phenomenon, physicsts also appear to be interested in the **3 dimensional quantum hall effect**.

Originally proposed by [@Halperin1987], lately some experimental success has been had with it [@Tang2019].

This is important for my thesis as I have up until now been assuming that the QHE is actually a 3D thing, treated as 2D out of laziness/ease, but having people talk separately about the 3D effect makes me question this a little. I still think I'm right, but it would be wise to include this somewhere in the [[FQHE or anyon chapter|FQHE/anyon chapter]].

Furthermore, it seems that for physicists the [[Dimensionality of an electron gas is determined by Fermi Surface topology]]

I think this will make good 'catches' section at the end of the chapter, but I don't need to concern myself with it just yet.
