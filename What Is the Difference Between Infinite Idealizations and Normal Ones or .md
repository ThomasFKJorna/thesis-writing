# Context: For my next meeting with Ronnie I have to figure out what the difference is between idealizations and infinite idealizations.

"Solved" this here [[Categorization of idealizations]]

# Body:

### [@Norton2012]

#### What is their claim?

##### Idealizations are simply thought up systems whose properties approximately describe a target system we're interested in.

##### Infinite idealizations are idealizations in which some quantity is taken to infinity (or zero). This can cause a problem or not depending on whether the system smoothly approaches the limit or not

#### What are their reasons?

#### What do I think of them?

### [@Strevens2007]

#### What is their stance?

##### Idealizations are a type of model/explanation in which some things are false. Those things that are false do not make a difference to the explanation, and so the idealization is a better explanation than for instance one that takes account of every single interaction, because the latter includes a lot of things that do not make a difference.

##### Infinities and zeros are used in idealizations to indicate that a certain quantity does not make a difference to the explanation.

##### However, things can also be set to a certain "default value", not sure how that affects things.

#### What are their reasons?

##### Strevens is very much committed to his account of explanation, which is a causal one based on difference makers

##### To explain something is to point out which things make a difference to the end result and which ones do not, which is how he gets to his account of idealization.

#### What do I think of it?

##### I think it's commiting too hard to a certain view of explanation when describing idealization, however this might also be something that NOrtnon for instance also does but just not explicility.

### VERY RELEVANT: [@Strevens2019a]

## Things to ponder:

### Do idealizations ever set something to a different value than zero or infinity?

### Do idealizations always get rid of something or do they create something new?
