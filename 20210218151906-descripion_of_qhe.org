* Context

This is the start of the train of thought about the (F)QHE


* Very broad description

The (Fractional) quantum hall effect is a "variation" on the [[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]

[[./media/fqhe.png]]


The main difference is that the

The transversal (Hall) resistance turns out not to vary clean and linearly, but is quantized at $R_H = h/e^2v$ .
The longitudinal resistance turns out to vanish when the Hall resistance is a multiple of $R_H$

$\nu$ is called the filling factor, its the ratio between the filled and empty electron states, and has both fractional and integer values, shockingly called the integer and fractional quantum hall effect respectively.

The FQHE is said to be explained by using quasiparticles interacting with impurities. These quasiparticles have[[file:20210218152830-fractional_quantum_statistics.org][fractional quantum statistics]]  and are thus [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].

The precision of the quantized Hall effect is particularly surprising because the hall resistance is normally very sensitive to small changes.

Apparently doesnt care about specifics -->[[file:20210218172455-universality.org][universality]]
