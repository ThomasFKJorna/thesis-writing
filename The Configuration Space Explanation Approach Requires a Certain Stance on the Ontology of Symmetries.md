# The configuration space approach to explaining anyons requires a certain commitment to how seriously one takes symmetries in physics

Shech argues that the configuration space framework is the only way we can explain the emergence of anyons. However, I believe that this requires one to look at symmetries a certain way, namely as something along the lines of them being ontological.
