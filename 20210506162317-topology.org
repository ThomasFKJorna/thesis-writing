* Topology

** Munkres

A *topology* on a set $X$ is a collection $T$ of subsets of $X$ such that
1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $T$
2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of $T$ is in $T$
3) The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $T$ is in $T$.

A set $X$ which has a topology specified on it is called a [[file:20210403182645-topological_space.org][Topological space]].
