#+title: My main goal is to show how the Berry phase approximates topological phase
#+filetags: phase anyons thesis fqhe


* The main goal of my case study on FQHE is to show that the Berry phase can approximate the topological phase

In my chapter [[file:chapter-anyons.org][Structure FQHE/anyon chapter]], I am talking a lot of bullshit, which makes me forget my main goal:
Show how to approximate the [[file:20210327154504-the_configuration_space_explanation_of_anyons.org][The configuration space explanation of anyons]] using the  [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]/[[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]].

By approximate I mean this in Norton's sense [[file:20201218175548-idealization_vs_approximation.org][Idealization vs Approximation]]: show how  taking increasing or decreasing some property gets us closer and closer to the topological phase calculation, in a smooth fashion.

This can be done in two ways: show how to calculate the phase, or show that the space is approximately simply connected. The latter is much more difficult.

* Entry points

As I think about it now, I need to figure out how [[file:20210513124338-monodromy_is_an_infinite_idealization_of_holonomy.org][Monodromy is an infinite idealization of holonomy]]
