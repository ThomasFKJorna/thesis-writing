In his recent paper, Ken Akiba raises two objections against Barnes-Williams theory, concluding that it is <em>ill-conceived and wrong-headed</em>. In one objection, he argues that the theory implies indeterminate identity between referentially determinate objects to which <em>λ</em>-abstraction is applicable, and hence Evans’ argument ultimately goes through. In the other, he objects that Barnes-Williams theory also fails to block Salmon’s argument. This paper discusses the two objections. It argues that there are legitimate reasons for rejecting both, and hence to revive Barnes-Williams theory. Furthermore, it is shown that the objections, while unsuccessful, are helpful in revealing the limitations of Barnes-Williams theory.</p></section>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Abasnezhad","given":"Ali"}],"container-title":"Metaphysica","DOI":"10.1515/mp-2016-0015","ISSN":"1437-2053, 1874-6373","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"195-205","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"How (Not) To Argue Against Vague Object","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/mp/17/2/article-p195.xml","volume":"17"},

Such particles—or quasi-particle excitations—can occur in two-dimensional systems in which the particles experience strong short-range mutual repulsions. These circumstances effectively mean that one has to apply quantum mechanics to a configuration space in which some points are excluded (i.e. it has ‘holes’)—namely, those points where two particles would coincide. The Aharonov—Bohm effect provides the simplest physical example of quantum mechanics in such a non-simply connected space, and is also fundamental to a simple model for anyons. A qualitative introduction is given to two currently proposed physical applications of anyons: high temperature superconductivity, and the (fractional) quantum Hall effect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Aitchison","given":"I.

  {"id":"Antonopoulos2008","abstract":"The question whether quantum discontinuity can or cannot provide an answer to Zeno’s Paradoxes is reopened. It is observed that what is usually understood by the term “discontinuity”, namely, Einstein’s conception of the photon as described by himself and all others, is unsuitable to the task because, essentially, it reduces to the trivial ‘discontinuity’ of objects scattered in space. By contrast, quantization of energy levels, which are not in space but can only alternate in time, provide the right sort of discontinuity required. Discrete quantized orbits, corresponding to eigen-frequencies, are irreducible, and nothing is allowed to stand in-between them in satisfaction of the quantum postulate, furnishing the requisite, and so far missing, immediate nextness of a point to a certain other. In this way, Zeno’s Runner need not postpone his first step indefinitely, always waiting upon an infinity of preceding steps, before it can be taken. There is now a point that is next to a point and so a step on that point, which is the first step. It follows that, if one kind of discontinuity, Einstein’s, is incapable of offerring an answer to Zeno, while another kind can, the two are discrepant. One of them, the former, is not a kind of discontinuity properly so called at all, though evidently\nthe consequence of one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Antonopoulos","given":"Constantin"}],"container-title":"THEORIA.

In this paper, we investigate why, to perform this task, scientists sometimes choose to use numerical methods instead of analytical solutions.

Nevertheless, Menon and Callender (2013) have outlined theoretical approaches that describe phase transitions without using the infinite limit. This paper closely investigates one of these approaches, which consists of studying the complex zeros of the partition function (Borrmann et al., 2000). Based on this theory, I argue for the plausibility for eliminating the infinite limit for studying phase transitions.

  {"id":"Bacciagaluppi2019","abstract":"There are two notions in the philosophy of probability that are often used interchangeably: that of subjective probabilities and that of epistemic probabilities. This paper suggests they should be kept apart. Specifically, it suggests that the distinction between subjective and objective probabilities refers to what probabilities are, while the distinction between epistemic and ontic probabilities refers to what probabilities are about. After arguing that there are bona fide examples of subjective ontic probabilities and of epistemic objective probabilities, I propose a systematic way of drawing these distinctions in order to take this into account. In doing so, I modify Lewis's notion of chances, and extend his Principal Principle in what I argue is a very natural way (which in fact makes chances fundamentally conditional).

  {"id":"Bain2016","abstract":"For some authors, an adequate notion of emergence must include an account of a mechanism by means of which emergent behavior is realized. This appeal to mechanism is problematic in the case of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). There is a consensus among physicists that the FQHE exhibits emergent phenomena, but there are at least four alternative explanations of the latter that, arguably, appeal to ontologically distinct mechanisms, both at the microphysics level and at the level of general organizing principles. In light of this underdetermination of mechanism, one is faced with the following options: (I) deny that emergence is present in the FQHE; (II) argue for the priority of one mechanistic explanation over the others; or (III) temper the desire for a mechanism-centric account of emergence. I will argue that there are good reasons to reject (I) and (II) and accept (III). In particular, I will suggest that a law-centric account of emergence does just fine in explaining the emergent phenomena associated with the FQHE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bain","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.09.002","ISSN":"1355-2198","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"27-38","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Emergence and mechanism in the fractional quantum Hall effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219816300399","volume":"56"},

This instance of extra-logical explanation is subsequently shown to be of a piece with cases of extra-mathematical explanation.

I formulate a version of the phase transition paradox based on the idea that infinite idealizations are explanatorily indispensable to our best science, and so ought to attract a realist attitude. I go on to offer a solution to the paradox by drawing a distinction between two types of indispensability: constructive and substantive indispensability.

In a final section it is suggested that by substituting the word \"object\" for the word \"set\" a similar argument arises which can then be used to refute the identification of numbers with any given system of objects: to characterize the numbers is to characterize not a system of objects but an abstract structure which many systems of objects might exhibit.","author":[{"family":"Benacerraf","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"The Philosophical Review","DOI":"10.2307/2183530","ISSN":"00318108","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1965]]},"page":"47","title":"What Numbers Could not Be","type":"article-journal","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"Bennett","abstract":"The paper considers the problem of deﬁning concepts within formal ontologies. A number of distinct modes of deﬁnition are identiﬁed, which represent alternative viewpoints on the classiﬁcation of objects. The nature of these modes is examined and interactions and correlations between them are considered. This analysis is used to characterise a number of key problems that confront the attempt to analyse the meanings of natural language concepts by means of a precise formal ontology. Some proposals are made as to how these problems might be overcome. It is argued that speciﬁcation of precise formal semantics requires clear separation between aspects of meaning that are based on diﬀerent modes of classiﬁcation. But, to provide an adequate ontological framework to describe the semantics of natural language terms, additional formal apparatus is required to synthesise their meaning by combining the diﬀerent modes. This meta-level ontological formalism must articulate the interactions between the diﬀerent modes.","author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Brandon"}],"language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Modes of Concept Deﬁnition and Varieties of Vagueness∗","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Berkovitz2020","abstract":"The mathematical nature of modern physics suggests that mathematics is bound to play some role in explaining physical reality. Yet, there is an ongoing controversy about the prospects of mathematical explanations of physical facts and their nature. A common view has it that mathematics provides a rich and indispensable language for representing physical reality but that, ontologically, physical facts are not mathematical and, accordingly, mathematical facts cannot really explain physical facts. In what follows, I challenge this common view. I argue that, in modern natural science, mathematics is constitutive of the physical. Given the mathematical constitution of the physical, I propose an account of explanation in which mathematical frameworks, structures, and facts explain physical facts. In this account, mathematical explanations of physical facts are either species of physical explanations of physical facts in which the mathematical constitution of some physical facts in the explanans are highlighted, or simply explanations in which the mathematical constitution of physical facts are highlighted. In highlighting the mathematical constitution of physical facts, mathematical explanations of physical facts make the explained facts intelligible or deepen and expand the scope of our understanding of them. I argue that, unlike other accounts of mathematical explanations of physical facts, the proposed account is not subject to the objection that mathematics only represents the physical facts that actually do the explanation. I conclude by briefly considering the implications that the mathematical constitution of the physical has for the question of the unreasonable effectiveness of the use of mathematics in physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Berkovitz","given":"Joseph"}],"collection-title":"Jerusalem Studies in Philosophy and History of Science","container-title":"Quantum, Probability, Logic: The Work and Influence of Itamar Pitowsky","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-34316-3_6; https://web.archive.org/web/20211027052859/https://link.springer.com/springerlink-static/1923692707/css/styles.css","editor":[{"family":"Hemmo","given":"Meir"},{"family":"Shenker","given":"Orly"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-34316-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"125-164","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"On the Mathematical Constitution and Explanation of Physical Facts","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34316-3_6"},

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Berry","given":"Michael Victor"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

  {"id":"Berry1997","abstract":"The quantum mechanics of two identical particles with spin S in three dimensions is reformulated by employing not the usual fixed spin basis but a transported spin basis that exchanges the spins along with the positions. Such a basis, required to be smooth and parallel-transported, can be generated by an ‘exchange rotation’ operator resembling angular momentum. This is constructed from the four harmonic oscillators from which the two spins are made according to Schwinger's scheme. It emerges automatically that the phase factor accompanying spin exchange with the transported basis is just the Pauli sign, that is (−1)2S. Singlevaluedness of the total wavefunction, involving the transported basis, then implies the correct relation between spin and statistics. The Pauli sign is a geometric phase factor of topological origin, associated with non-contractible circuits in the doubly connected (and non-orientable) configuration space of relative positions with identified antipodes.

All entities are crisp, on this semantic view, but there are, for each vague name, multiple portions of reality that are equally good candidates for being its referent, and, for each vague predicate, multiple classes of objects that are equally good candidates for being its extension. We provide a new formulation of these ideas in terms of a theory of granular partitions. We show that this theory provides a general framework within which we can understand the relation between vague terms and concepts and the corresponding crisp portions of reality. We also sketch how it might be possible to formulate within this framework a theory of vagueness which dispenses with the notion of truth-value gaps and other artifacts of more familiar approaches. Central to our approach is the idea that judgments about reality involve in every case (1) a separation of reality into foreground and background of attention and (2) the feature of granularity. On this basis we attempt to show that even vague judgments made in naturally occurring contexts are not marked by truth-value indeterminacy. We distinguish, in addition to crisp granular partitions, also vague partitions, and reference partitions, and we explain the role of the latter in the context of judgments that involve vagueness. We conclude by showing how reference partitions provide an effective means by which judging subjects are able to temper the vagueness of their judgments by means of approximations.","author":[{"family":"Bittner","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Barry"}],"language":"en","page":"39","source":"Zotero","title":"A Unified Theory of Granularity, Vagueness, and Approximation","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Bobzien2020","abstract":"Intuitionistic logic provides an elegant solution to the Sorites Paradox. Its acceptance has been hampered by two factors. First, the lack of an accepted semantics for languages containing vague terms has led even philosophers sympathetic to intuitionism to complain that no explanation has been given of why intuitionistic logic is the correct logic for such languages. Second, switching from classical to intuitionistic logic, while it may help with the Sorites, does not appear to offer any advantages when dealing with the so-called paradoxes of higher-order vagueness. We offer a proposal that makes strides on both issues. We argue that the intuitionist’s characteristic rejection of any third alethic value alongside true and false is best elaborated by taking the normal modal system S4M to be the sentential logic of the operator ‘it is clearly the case that’. S4M opens the way to an account of higher-order vagueness which avoids the paradoxes that have been thought to infect the notion. S4M is one of the modal counterparts of the intuitionistic sentential calculus (IPC) and we use this fact to explain why IPC is the correct sentential logic to use when reasoning with vague statements. We also show that our key results go through in an intuitionistic version of S4M. Finally, we deploy our analysis to reply to Timothy Williamson’s objections to intuitionistic treatments of vagueness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bobzien","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Rumfitt","given":"Ian"}],"container-title":"Journal of Philosophical Logic","container-title-short":"J Philos Logic","DOI":"10.1007/s10992-019-09507-x","ISSN":"1573-0433","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"221-248","source":"Springer Link","title":"Intuitionism and the Modal Logic of Vagueness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-019-09507-x","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"Bueno2012","abstract":"We argue that standard definitions of ‘vagueness’ prejudice the question of how best to deal with the phenomenon of vagueness. In particular, the usual understanding of ‘vagueness’ in terms of borderline cases, where the latter are thought of as truth-value gaps, begs the question against the subvaluational approach. According to this latter approach, borderline cases are inconsistent (i.e., glutty not gappy). We suggest that a definition of ‘vagueness’ should be general enough to accommodate any genuine contender in the debate over how to best deal with the sorites paradox.

  {"id":"Bunge2017","abstract":"Axiomatization is uncommon outside mathematics, partly for being often viewed as embalming, partly because the best-known axiomatizations have serious shortcomings, and partly because it has had only one eminent champion, namely David Hilbert (Math Ann 78:405–415, 1918). The aims of this paper are (a) to describe what will be called dual axiomatics, for it concerns not just the formalism, but also the meaning (reference and sense) of the key concepts; and (b) to suggest that every instance of dual axiomatics presupposes some philosophical view or other. To illustrate these points, a theory of solidarity will be crafted and axiomatized, and certain controversies in both classical and quantum physics, as well as in the philosophy of mind, will be briefly discussed. The upshot of this paper is that dual axiomatics, unlike the purely formal axiomatics favored by the structuralists school, is not a luxury but a tool helping resolve some scientific controversies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunge","given":"Mario"}],"container-title":"Foundations of Science","container-title-short":"Found Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10699-016-9493-8","ISSN":"1572-8471","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00012","page":"695-707","source":"Springer Link","title":"Why Axiomatize?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10699-016-9493-8","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"Cartwright1983a","abstract":"Nancy Cartwright argues for a novel conception of the role of fundamental scientific laws in modern natural science. If we attend closely to the manner in which theoretical laws figure in the practice of science, we see that despite their great explanatory power these laws do not describe reality. Instead, fundamental laws describe highly idealized objects in models. Thus, the correct account of explanation in science is not the traditional covering law view, but the 'simulacrum' account. On this view, explanation is a matter of constructing a model that may employ, but need not be consistent with, a theoretical framework, in which phenomenological laws that are true of the empirical case in question can be derived. Anti-realism about theoretical laws does not, however, commit one to anti-realism about theoretical entities. Belief in theoretical entities can be grounded in well-tested localized causal claims about concrete physical processes, sometimes now called 'entity realism'. Such causal claims provide the basis for partial realism and they are ineliminable from the practice of explanation and intervention in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Nancy"}],"DOI":"10.1093/0198247044.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-19-824704-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,6,9]]},"language":"en","note":"04928","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How the Laws of Physics Lie","type":"book","URL":"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198247044.001.0001/acprof-9780198247043"},

Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov–Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov–Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Eliahu"},{"family":"Larocque","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Bouchard","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Nejadsattari","given":"Farshad"},{"family":"Gefen","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Karimi","given":"Ebrahim"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Physics","DOI":"10.1038/s42254-019-0071-1","ISSN":"2522-5820","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7","page":"437-449","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group; https://web.archive.org/web/20210511100743/https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0071-1","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Geometric phase from Aharonov–Bohm to Pancharatnam–Berry and beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0071-1","volume":"1"},

He argued that to draw such an inference is to commit “the fallacy of verbalism”. I argue that this is only a fallacy if we have no reason to believe that the world is as our language says. Since vagueness is apparently not eliminable from our language—a fact that Russell himself acknowledged—an indispensability argument can be launched for metaphysical vagueness. In this paper I outline such an argument.","author":[{"family":"Colyvan","given":"Mark"}],"language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Russell on Metaphysical Vagueness","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Companion2017","abstract":"\"Thought experiments are a means of imaginative reasoning that lie at the heart of philosophy, from the pre-Socratics to the modern era, and they also play central roles in a range of fields, from physics to politics. The Routledge Companion to Thought Experiments is an invaluable guide and reference source to this multifaceted subject. Comprising over 30 chapters by a team of international contributors, the Companion covers the following important areas: the history of thought experiments, from antiquity to the trolley problem and quantum non-locality; thought experiments in the humanities, arts, and sciences, including ethics, physics, theology, biology, mathematics, economics, and politics; theories about the nature of thought experiments; new discussions concerning the impact of experimental philosophy, cross-cultural comparison studies, metaphilosophy, computer simulations, idealization, dialectics, cognitive science, the artistic nature of thought experiments, and metaphysical issues. This broad ranging Companion goes backwards through history and sideways across disciplines. It also engages with philosophical perspectives from empiricism, rationalism, naturalism, skepticism, pluralism, contextualism, and neo-Kantianism to phenomenology. This volume will be valuable for anyone studying the methods of philosophy or any discipline that employs thought experiments, as well as anyone interested in the power and limits of the mind.\"--The publisher.

In particular, many important infinitely large entities can be characterised in terms of such axiomatisations. We consider reasons for the delay in arriving at the coalgebraic framework, despite many unrecognised manifestations occurring years earlier, and discuss an apparent asymmetry in the relationship between algebra and coalgebra.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Corfield","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsa.2011.09.013","ISSN":"0039-3681","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"571-579","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Understanding the infinite II: Coalgebra","title-short":"Understanding the infinite II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003936811100077X","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"Daly2011","abstract":"Vagueness is ubiquitous in natural language. It seems incompatible with classical, bivalent logic, which tells us that every statement is either true or false, and none is vaguely true. Yet we do manage to reason using vague natural language. In fact, the majority of our day-to-day reasoning involves vague terms and concepts. There is a puzzle here: how do we perform this remarkable feat of reasoning? I argue that vagueness is a kind of semantic indecision. In short, that means we cannot say exactly who is bald and who is not because we have never decided the precise meaning of the word 'bald'--there are some borderline cases in the middle, which might be bald or might not. That is a popular general strategy for addressing vagueness. Those who use it, however, do not often say what they mean by 'borderline case'. It is most frequently used in a loose way to refer to in-between items: those people who are neither clearly bald nor clearly not bald. But under that loose description, the notion of borderline cases is ambiguous, and some of its possible meanings create serious problems for semantic theories of vagueness.Here, I clarify the notion of a borderline case, so that borderline cases can be used profitably as a key element in a successful theory of vagueness. After carefully developing my account of borderline cases, I demonstrate its usefulness by proposing a theory of vagueness based upon it. My theory, vagueness as permission, explains how classical logic can be used to model even vague natural language.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Daly","given":"Helen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"Accepted: 2011-10-14T22:21:43Z","publisher":"The University of Arizona.","source":"repository.arizona.edu","title":"Vagueness and Borderline Cases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/145428"},

  {"id":"DeBianchi2016","abstract":"In The Explanatory Dispensability of Idealizations, Sam Baron suggests a possible strategy enabling the indispensability argument to break the symmetry between mathematical claims and idealization assumptions in scientific models. Baron’s distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical idealization, I claim, is in need of a more compelling criterion, because in scientific models idealization assumptions are expressed through mathematical claims. In this paper I argue that this mutual dependence of idealization and mathematics cannot be read in terms of symmetry and that Baron’s non-causal notion of mathematical difference-making is not effective in justifying any symmetry-breaking between mathematics and idealization. The function of making a difference that Baron attributes to mathematics cannot be referred to physical facts, but to the features of quantities, such as step lengths or time intervals taken into account in the models. It appears, indeed, that it does not follow from Baron’s argument that idealizations do not help to carry the explanatory load at least for two reasons: (1) mathematics is not independent of idealizations in modelling and (2) idealizations help mathematics to carry the explanatory load of a model in different degrees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"De Bianchi","given":"Silvia"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-015-0795-0","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00009","page":"387-401","source":"Springer Link","title":"Which explanatory role for mathematics in scientific models?

  {"id":"DeGroot2020","abstract":"Studies in the field of psychology often employ (computerized) behavioral tasks, aimed at mimicking real-world situations that elicit certain actions in participants. Such tasks are for example used to study risk propensity, a trait-like tendency towards taking or avoiding risk. One of the most popular tasks for gauging risk propensity is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002), which has been shown to relate well to self-reported risk-taking and to real-world risk behaviors. However, despite its popularity and qualities, the BART has several methodological shortcomings, most of which have been reported before, but none of which are widely known. In the present paper, four such problems are explained and elaborated on: a lack of clarity as to whether decisions are characterized by uncertainty or risk; censoring of observations; confounding of risk and expected value; and poor decomposability into adaptive and maladaptive risk behavior. Furthermore, for every problem, a range of possible solutions is discussed, which overall can be divided into three categories: using a different, more informative outcome index than the standard average pump score; modifying one or more task elements; or using a different task, either an alternative risk-taking task (sequential or otherwise), or a custom-made instrument. It is important to make use of these solutions, as applying the BART without accounting for its shortcomings may lead to interpretational problems, including false-positive and false-negative results. Depending on the research aims of a given study, certain shortcomings are more pressing than others, indicating the (type of) solutions most needed. By combining solutions and openly discussing shortcomings, researchers may be able to modify the BART in such a way that it can operationalize risk propensity without substantial methodological problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"De Groot","given":"Kristel"}],"container-title":"Journal of Trial and Error","container-title-short":"JOTE","DOI":"10.36850/mr1","ISSN":"2667-1204","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,8]]},"language":"en","note":"00000","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Burst Beliefs – Methodological Problems in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Implications for Its Use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://archive.jtrialerror.com/pub/burstbeliefs"},

The account we give of such paradoxes plays a pivotal role for our understanding of natural languages. If our reasoning involves any vague concepts, is it safe from contradiction? Do vague concepts really lack any sharp boundary? If not, why are we reluctant to accept the existence of any sharp boundary for them? And what rules of inference can we validly apply, if we reason in vague terms?

  {"id":"Dougherty2020","abstract":"Elay Shech and John Earman have recently argued that the common topological interpretation of the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect is unsatisfactory because it fails to justify idealizations that it presupposes. In particular, they argue that an adequate account of the AB effect must address the role of boundary conditions in certain ideal cases of the effect. In this paper I defend the topological interpretation against their criticisms. I consider three types of idealization that might arise in treatments of the effect. First, Shech takes the AB effect to involve an idealization in the form of a singular limit, analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical mechanics. But, I argue, the AB effect itself features no singular limits, so it doesn’t involve idealizations in this sense. Second, I argue that Shech and Earman’s emphasis on the role of boundary conditions in the AB effect is misplaced. The idealizations that are useful in connecting the theoretical description of the AB effect to experiment do interact with facts about boundary conditions, but none of these idealizations are presupposed by the topological interpretation of the effect. Indeed, the boundary conditions for which Shech and demands justification are incompatible with some instances of the AB effect, so the topological interpretation ought not justify them. Finally, I address the role of the non-relativistic approximation usually presumed in discussions of the AB effect. This approximation is essential if—as the topological interpretation supposes—the AB effect constrains and justifies a relativistic theory of the electromagnetic interaction. In this case the ends justify the means. So the topological view presupposes no unjustified idealizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Dougherty","given":"John"}],"genre":"Published Article or Volume","ISSN":"1573-0964","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Springer (Springer Science+Business Media B.V.); https://web.archive.org/web/20210511125226/https://www.google-analytics.com/r/__utm.gif?utmwv=5.7.2&amp;utms=1&amp;utmn=1011419780&amp;utmhn=philsci-archive.pitt.edu&amp;utmcs=UTF-8&amp;utmsr=1600x1000&amp;utmvp=1051x6854&amp;utmsc=24-bit&amp;utmul=en-us&amp;utmje=0&amp;utmfl=-&amp;utmdt=The%20non-ideal%20theory%20of%20the%20Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm%20effect%20-%20PhilSci-Archive&amp;utmhid=810370799&amp;utmr=-&amp;utmp=%2F18057%2F&amp;utmht=1620737546417&amp;utmac=UA-30975537-5&amp;utmcc=__utma%3D187903081.1844152389.1620737546.1620737546.1620737546.1%3B%2B__utmz%3D187903081.1620737546.1.1.utmcsr%3D(direct)%7Cutmccn%3D(direct)%7Cutmcmd%3D(none)%3B&amp;utmjid=1315787069&amp;utmredir=1&amp;utmu=qAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE~","title":"The non-ideal theory of the Aharonov–Bohm effect","type":"manuscript","URL":"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/18057/"},

Specifically, through a close reading of James’s account of ‘conceptions’ in the Principles, I examine the tension between these ‘conceptions’ construed as discrete and self-identical and James’s famous phenomenological description of consciousness as a continuous stream. Such a tension primarily involves the intersection of an epistemic need (or condition of possibility) with a quasi-metaphysical intuition or postulate (continuity). Importantly, this tension is intensified by the methodological constraints of bracketing metaphysical questions that James sets for himself in the Principles. James’s decision to deny the cogency of this methodological bracketing can therefore be read as his response to the tension I examine and his speculative turn to “radical empiricism” as an attempt to resolve epistemological difficulties by going more radical ontologically. Doing so raises questions about the status of speculative metaphysics in intersection with empirical inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]]},"author":[{"literal":"Duvernoy"}],"container-title":"Transactions of the Charles S.

  {"id":"Earman2019","abstract":"On standard accounts of scientific theorizing, the role of idealizations is to facilitate the analysis of some real world system by employing a simplified representation of the target system, raising the obvious worry about how reliable knowledge can be obtained from inaccurate descriptions. The idealizations involved in the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect do not, it is claimed, fit this paradigm; rather the target system is a fictional system characterized by features that, though physically possible, are not realized in the actual world. The point of studying such a fictional system is to understand the foundations of quantum mechanics and how its predictions depart from those of classical mechanics. The original worry about the use of idealizations is replaced by a new one; namely, how can actual world experiments serve to confirm the AB effect if it concerns the behavior of a fictional system? Struggle with this issue helps to account for the fact that almost three decades elapsed before a consensus emerged that the predicted AB effect had received solid experimental support. Standard accounts of idealizations tout the role they play in making tractable the analysis of the target system; by contrast, the idealizations involved in the AB effect make its analysis both conceptually and mathematically challenging. The idealizations required for the AB effect are also responsible for the existence of unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations and of the current algebra, representations which an observer confined to the electron’s configuration space could invoke to ‘explain’ AB-type effect without the need to posit a hidden magnetic field. The goal of this paper is to bring to the attention of the philosophers of science these and other aspects of the AB effect which are neglected or inadequately treated in literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Earman","given":"John"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-017-1522-9","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00011","page":"1991-2019","source":"Springer Link","title":"The role of idealizations in the Aharonov–Bohm effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-017-1522-9","volume":"196"},
  {"id":"Elgin2002","abstract":"Nancy Cartwright (1983, 1999) argues that (1) the fundamental laws of physics are true when and only when appropriate ceteris paribus modifiers are attached and that (2) ceteris paribus modifiers describe conditions that are almost never satisfied. She concludes that when the fundamental laws of physics are true, they don't apply in the real world, but only in highly idealized counterfactual situations. In this paper, we argue that (1) and (2) together with an assumption about contraposition entail the opposite conclusion — that the fundamental laws of physics do apply in the real world. Cartwright extracts from her thesis about the inapplicability of fundamental laws the conclusion that they cannot figure in covering-law explanations. We construct a different argument for a related conclusion — that forward-directed idealized dynamical laws cannot provide covering-law explanations that are causal. This argument is neutral on whether the assumption about contraposition is true.

Philosophers of science have sought to explain how these models relate to the world. On most accounts, models do not represent the world directly, but through target systems. However, our knowledge of target systems is incomplete. First, what is the process by which target systems come about? Second, what types of entity are they? I argue that the basic conception of target systems, on which other conceptions depend, is as parts of the world. I outline the process of target system specification and show that it is a crucial step in modelling. I also develop an account of target system evaluation, based on aptness. Paying close attention to target system specification and evaluation can help scientists minimise the frequency and extent of mistakes, when they are using models to investigate phenomena in complex real-world systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Elliott-Graves","given":"Alkistis"}],"container-title":"Biology & Philosophy","container-title-short":"Biol Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s10539-020-09745-3","ISSN":"1572-8404","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,12]]},"language":"en","note":"00001","page":"28","source":"Springer Link","title":"What is a target system?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-020-09745-3","volume":"35"},

Digital vs. analogue is a Boolean dichotomy typical of our computational paradigm, but digital and analogue are only “modes of presentation” of Being (to paraphrase Kant), that is, ways in which reality is experienced or conceptualised by an epistemic agent at a given level of abstraction. A preferable alternative is provided by an informational approach to structural realism, according to which knowledge of the world is knowledge of its structures. The most reasonable ontological commitment turns out to be in favour of an interpretation of reality as the totality of structures dynamically interacting with each other.

Furthermore, it should be neutral with respect to locating vagueness in epistemology or language. Following Bueno and Colyvan (2012), I argue in favour of characterising vagueness purely in terms of sorites susceptibility. However, I caution that the sorites argument can also be used to diagnose epistemic uncertainty of other sorts (or epistemic vagueness, according to Sauerland and Stateva, 2007) if we allow for partially ordered sets. This seems like an undesirable result as it captures phenomena which are fundamentally different than pure (scalar) vagueness.

Moreover, a better terminology for the so-called real numbers is “random numbers”, as their series of bits are truly random. I propose an alternative classical mechanics, which is empirically equivalent to classical mechanics, but uses only finite-information numbers. This alternative classical mechanics is non-deterministic, despite the use of deterministic equations, in a way similar to quantum theory. Interestingly, both alternative classical mechanics and quantum theories can be supplemented by additional variables in such a way that the supplemented theory is deterministic.

They claim to catch Wittgenstein pooh-poohing the modern set-theoretic extensional conception of a real number. This article, however, will show that Wittgenstein's criticism is well grounded. A real number, as an ‘extension’, is a homeless fiction; ‘homeless’ in that it neither is supported by anything nor supports anything. The picture of a real number as an ‘extension’ is not supported by actual practice in calculus; calculus has nothing to do with ‘extensions’. The extensional, set-theoretic conception of a real number does not give a foundation for real analysis, either. The so-called complete theory of real numbers, which is essentially an extensional approach, does not define (in any sense of the word) the set of real numbers so as to justify their completeness, despite the common belief to the contrary. The only correct foundation of real analysis consists in its being ‘existential axiomatics’.

  {"id":"Hartmann2010","abstract":"Scientific explanation and causation are two of the most enduring topics of debate in the philosophy of science. Michael Strevens' extraordinary 500-page tome, Depth, constitutes the latest addition to both of these venerable and vital debates. Strevens identifies his book as a contribution to work on the nature of explanation; however, his theory of explanation purports to teach us important and surprising new things about causation as well. Depth thus commands the attention of today's philosophers of science, because of the importance of these two issues, and also because of Strevens' impressive intellectual talents.  Depth has five main parts. In what follows, we first give a brief summary of what we take to be the most important and interesting points in each of these. Then we offer two criticisms, one aimed generally at Strevens' methodology and one aimed specifically at some of the book's content.  In Part I (\"The Causal Approach to Explanation\"), Strevens makes some important preliminary clarifications and then offers an admittedly colored overview of recent accounts of explanation and high-level causation. Strevens notes that he is interested in analyzing explanation in an ontological sense, such that \"explanation [is] something out in the world, a set of facts to be discovered\" (p. 6). Additionally, he focuses his project so that its aim is \"purely descriptive\" (p. 37).  In pursuit of this project, Strevens advocates a \"two-factor causal account of explanation.\" That is, as opposed to giving an account of causation and positing that any causal influence on an effect e thereby is a necessary part of the full explanation for e (a \"one-factor approach\"), Strevens asserts that the explanation of e is only made up of those causal influences of e that pass a second test for \"explanatory relevance.\"[1] This second factor ultimately is supposed to single out those causal influences that \"make a difference\" to the occurrence of e. Strevens introduces his Kairetic account to serve this purpose.  Part II (\"The Kairetic Account of Explanation\") details Strevens' account of difference-making, works this account into a fuller theory of event explanation, and then extends and applies this theory in several interesting ways. The Kairetic account attempts to extract a set of difference-makers from any veridical causal model for the explanandum event e. A veridical causal model is a set of true statements that causally entails the occurrence of e, where a set of statements causally entails that e occurs just in case the derivation of the occurrence of e from those statements \"mirrors a part of the causal process by which e was produced\" (p. 72). Given any veridical causal model for e then, the Kairetic account uncovers the corresponding difference-makers for e by locating the veridical causal model that is an abstraction of the original causal model[2] which optimizes a set of three desiderata: generality, cohesion, and accuracy. Strevens calls any model that is the end result of this procedure an explanatory kernel for e. Additionally, he claims that any explanatory kernel for e will necessarily be made up entirely of difference-makers for e. Pertaining to explanation then, Strevens asserts that a causal model is a complete explanation of an event \"just in case it is an explanatory kernel for that event … The optimizing procedure constructs standalone [complete] explanations\" (p. 117). In other words, a statement may be said to explain (partially) the occurrence of an event e only if that statement is a member of some explanatory kernel for e.  Strevens then applies his Kairetic account to the causation debate through his maxim that \"causal claims … are causal-explanatory claims\" (p. 4). Typically, theories of causal explanation give causal claims priority over the explanatory; one discovers the explanation of e by first deciding on the high-level causes of e -- i.e., those which render the statement that c caused e true. For Strevens, on the other hand, explanatory facts are prior to causal claims; statements that c caused e are shorthand for c is part of a causal explanation for the occurrence of e. With this understanding of causal claims, Strevens strives to show that many well-known puzzles and problems of causation dissolve. These include cases of preemption, cases where absences act as causes, and puzzles involving transitivity.  In Part III (\"Explanation of Laws and Regularities\"), Strevens shows how the Kairetic account of explanation can be made to apply to the explanations of statements of regularity (including laws). In short, where e represents any event that is an instance of the regularity in question, one explains that regularity by citing the explanatory kernel of e minus any initial conditions specific to e. Strevens calls this part of an explanatory kernel the causal mechanism and he offers the following fundamental theorem: \"The explanation of a causal generalization [regularity] and the explanation of any instance of the generalization invoke the same causal mechanism\" (p. 223).  Importantly, Strevens points out that, in many cases, high-level structures and patterns cited by statements of regularity (e.g., water, sexual reproduction in plants and animals on earth, Ford Pintos, etc.) are not cited by the causal mechanism appearing in the corresponding regularity explanation. In such a case, a basing generalization is necessary to make explicit the correspondence between the facts cited by the causal mechanism and those structural patterns (e.g., \"All water is H2O\"). There are several criteria that any such basing generalization must meet; most importantly, it must specify a relation of entanglement: F is entangled with P if \"All Fs have P\" is true and has sufficient scope, and if it is not true that \"if such and such an object with F had not had F, it would still have had P\" (p. 242). The notion of entanglement is, as Strevens points out, relatively weak insofar as it may be satisfied in the case that F is not responsible for bringing P about in any way. Lastly in Part III, Strevens uses his Kairetic account of regularity explanation to give a fascinating account of the role of idealization in science.  The Kairetic account of event explanation that Strevens develops in Part II is deterministic in the sense that any causal model under consideration must causally entail that the explanandum of interest e occurs. Thus, in Part IV (\"Probabilistic Explanation\"), Strevens considers the alternative case in which one may usefully give a probabilistic explanation of e. This section is far and away the most laborious for the careful reader as Strevens offers a taxonomy of probability[3] and accounts for probabilistic explanation in distinct ways depending upon the type of probability involved. For reasons of space, it is impossible for this review to summarize this part in greater detail. Suffice it to say that the rewards that come out of reading these chapters make a careful read worth the effort. Two of the most interesting conclusions that Strevens defends in these chapters are: (1) The size of a probability (or of a change in probability) cited in an explanation does make a difference to the goodness of that explanation; and (2) it is often better to explain a phenomenon probabilistically than deterministically -- even, in some cases, when that phenomenon is deterministically produced.  Part V (\"Valediction\") is very brief, only 17 pages long. In it Strevens demonstrates some of the key points from Parts I through IV by looking at specific puzzles of explanation that arise in some of the special sciences. And, lastly, he very briefly discusses the aesthetic features of, and rewards for, successful explanation.  Now on to our objections. As noted above, in the opening sections, Strevens focuses his project in several ways. First, he is interested in accounting for explanation in an ontological sense, such that \"explanation [is] something out in the world, a set of facts to be discovered\" (p. 6). Strevens distinguishes this sense of explanation from the sense of explanation as a \"means of communicating scientific knowledge.\" Second, Strevens focuses his project so that his aim is \"purely descriptive:\" the goal is \"to say what kinds of explanations we give and why we give them\" (p. 37). In pursuing this descriptive goal, Strevens appropriately recognizes that his \"most important source of evidence\" is the use of explanation in scientific practice itself (p. 37). This descriptive goal is distinguished from the normative goal of evaluating explanatory practice.  These two fundamental clarifications of Strevens' account seem, at least prima facie, to be at odds with each other. By pursuing a purely descriptive goal, one most directly connects with the sense of explanation as a means of communication; after all, a descriptive account tries to describe what is distinctive about those theories that scientists communicate as being explanatory. Similarly, when one examines actual and historical explanatory practice in the scientific literature, one directly accumulates evidence about how scientists communicate scientific knowledge. Thus, it would seem that Strevens' descriptive goal is best achieved in terms of the concept of explanation as a communicative act. Additionally, the observation of scientific practice would seem to be a potentially odd first choice of evidence if one is interested in spelling out an ontological sense of explanation, according to which scientists can often be wrong about their explanatory claims and practices. Epistemological and logical analysis, along with strong explanatory intuitions, would seem to be a more suitable first line of evidence.  Thankfully, in the end, it seems that Strevens actually makes much wider use of explanatory intuitions and epistemological and logical analysis than he wants to admit. After all, a certain \"Rasputin\" thought experiment upon which he continually draws throughout the entire book is far from a historical example drawn from \"the explanations regarded as scientifically adequate.\" Variations of this and other case studies are intended to pump clear and useful intuitions about the concept of explanation. And Strevens shows himself to be quite capable of strong and sound philosophical analysis. This distance from purely descriptive observations of scientific practice enables Strevens to say much that is useful to the analysis of the ontological sense of explanation.  It is difficult to accept that Strevens is only attempting a descriptive account of explanatory practice for at least one more reason. Aside from observing historical accounts of explanation, there is at least one more utterly crucial source of evidence for any purely descriptive account of any human practice: psychology. While Strevens pays lip service to this line of evidence by citing it as \"a possible third source of evidence\" (p. 38), he actually utilizes this source only once throughout all of Depth (p. 259). Moreover, the absence of such material does not immediately present itself as a glaringly obvious defect of the book. Our suggestion is that this is because Strevens' study differs from the purely descriptive project that he sets out in his introductory chapter.  For all of these reasons, it becomes unclear why Strevens' account should not be interpreted as a normative analysis of explanation. He sells his account as purely descriptive but his choices of method tell otherwise. The upshot to this first objection, then, can be phrased as a dilemma for Strevens. Either he is wrong or right that his is a purely descriptive project. If the former, then Strevens' account is actually doing something different than what he suggests. Instead of saying what kinds of explanations we do in fact give and why we give them, it is telling us what kinds of explanations we ought to give. This is only a problem insofar as Strevens is confused in his introductory chapter about the upshot of his project. On the other hand, if the latter horn of the dilemma holds true so that Strevens insists that his is a purely descriptive account, then the problem arises that he seems to be using the wrong toolbox of resources in pursuing his project. This is a far more serious problem.  A second objection: As large as Strevens' book is, his project is much larger; consequently a lot of important details go missing and promissory notes are written. In many ways, this is a blessing. After all, 500-plus pages of dense analytical philosophy of science is enough for one book, as elegant and enjoyable as the prose may be. Also, many new interesting and promising lines of research are opened to Strevens' devotees who desire to fill out the details wanting in Depth. But the absence of detail turns out, in some places, to be rather a curse for the theory as a whole.  In order to show this, we focus here on the absence of detail pertaining to the three central desiderata to the Kairetic account of difference-making: generality, cohesion, and accuracy. Recall that the explanation of any event or regularity is, in part, the causal model that constitutes the optimal combination of these three factors. In addition, Strevens clarifies that these desiderata can often interact and compete with one another forcing one to make tradeoffs between them (e.g., A certain causal model may not be the most accurate relative to the explanandum e, but it may still be the explanation of e if its lack of accuracy is made up for by its great generality; see section 5.2). Important questions thus immediately arise when one wants to apply the Kairetic account: What more precisely are generality, cohesion, and accuracy? How do we go about measuring the degree to which a causal model has any one of these factors (so that we can make sense of phrases like \"great generality\" or \"very little cohesion\")? How do we go about combining and comparing these three desiderata in order to go about choosing among various candidate explanations? These are absolutely necessary questions for giving the Kairetic account substance -- i.e., for being able to apply and test the Kairetic account. But Strevens unfortunately stops short of fully answering them.  Strevens does give some clarification in each case. For instance, regarding deterministic explanations, we learn at least the following: Generality has to do with the level of abstractness of a causal model; i.e., it counts the breadth of the space of possible systems for which the causal model would be veridical (p. 110). Defining cohesion is a complex and seemingly qualitative affair. Essentially, it seems for Strevens that a causal model either is or is not cohesive and that cohesion is equivalent to a notion of causal contiguity: \"A model is cohesive, I propose, if its realizers constitute a contiguous set in causal similarity space, or, as I will say, when its realizers are causally contiguous\" (p. 104).[4] Lastly, the accuracy of a causal model with respect to explanandum e is a measure of the similarity between that model's target (the conclusion causally entailed by the set of statements in the causal model) and the statement that e occurs (p. 142).[5] However, Strevens leaves unspecified just how the Kairetic account would have us measure the degree of similarity between two statements.  Notably, none of these clarifications leave us with the answers to our previous questions that we need. Instead, we are given hints of measures, but no measures. We are given definitions that seem hopelessly complex. For the Kairetic account to be more substantive then, there is much work to be done.  And how, we may ask, will Strevens' account fare if this work is successfully achieved? It is not clear that, if one were able to clarify the nuts and bolts of Strevens' Kairetic account, it would not then be self-defeating. Without trying to fill out the details (after all, that would be a wildly complex affair), it seems plausible that an account like, for example, Woodward's manipulationist account is much more general than Strevens' account -- there are fewer details needed in order to account for our explanatory practice -- while being at worst only slightly less accurate. But then, if we accept Strevens' account, it would seem quite feasible that we would be thereby obliged immediately to reject it in favor of this slightly less accurate, but more general account -- given that Strevens' account mandates accuracy/generality tradeoffs. That is, it is quite plausible that a successfully clarified version of Strevens' account of explanation mandates its own rejection.[6] Clearly then, the precise details of generality, cohesion, and accuracy very much need to be filled out, not only to give the Kairetic account more substance but also to render it defensible against this charge.  We have offered here a quick summary of Strevens' impressive book, Depth, along with two general objections to the account of scientific explanation given therein. Neither of these objections are put forward here with the aim of attacking Strevens' theory so much as with the aim of pointing to certain fundamental components of the theory that stand in serious need of further clarification. Moreover, our critical comments here are not meant to take away from our general endorsement of the book. Depth provides many intellectually stimulating and highly original thoughts on a number of critical and venerable philosophical topics. Any philosopher of science today will surely find it to be a rewarding read.  \n      [1] Pertaining to the nature of causation and causal influences, Strevens offers the ecumenical suggestion that most of the extant accounts of causation (including conserved quantity, counterfactual, and manipulation accounts) can accommodate the minimal assumptions about causality needed to fit our causal explanatory practice, and thus that we need not commit to a particular account of causation when analyzing explanation.      [2] An abstraction of the original model: (1) only references causal influences mentioned in the original model, and (2) contains only statements that are entailed by statements contained in the original model.      [3] This taxonomy as well as much of the conceptual groundwork for this section of Depth is taken from Strevens' previous book, Bigger than Chaos (Harvard UP, 2003).      [4] In order to avoid the challenge of defining and finding similarity spaces, Strevens introduces a necessary but insufficient condition for causal contiguity that acts as a test for cohesion: dynamic contiguity: \"Take the trajectories corresponding to every one of a model's concrete realizers, each a thread in state space. If this set of state space threads is contiguous, the model is dynamically contiguous\" (p. 105).      [5] Or, in the case that the causal model causally entails a range of possibilities, the accuracy is a measure of the similarity between the statement that e occurs and the member of this range of possibilities that is most dissimilar to e.      [6] Of course, this argument that Strevens' account may be self-defeating only holds if this account can itself be interpreted as providing an explanation of explanatory practice. This assumption seems warranted given Strevens' descriptive aim \"to say what kinds of explanations we give and why we give them\" (p. 37; emphasis ours).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Stephan"}],"ISSN":"1538-1617","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,30]]},"note":"00000 \nPublication: Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews","reviewed-author":[{"family":"Strevens","given":"Michael"}],"source":"Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews","title":"Review of <i>Depth: An Account of Scientific Explanation</i>","title-short":"Review of <i>Depth</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/depth-an-account-of-scientific-explanation/"},

  {"id":"Hunt2016","abstract":"Alan Baker’s enhanced indispensability argument (EIA) supports mathematical platonism through the explanatory role of mathematics in science. Busch and Morrison defend nominalism by denying that scientific realists use inference to the best explanation (IBE) to directly establish ontological claims. In response to Busch and Morrison, I argue that nominalists can rebut the EIA while still accepting Baker’s form of IBE. Nominalists can plausibly require that defenders of the EIA establish the indispensability of a particular mathematical entity. Next, I argue that IBE cannot establish that any particular mathematical entity is indispensable. Mathematical entities do not compete with each other in the way physical unobservables do. This lack of competition enables alternative formulations of scientific explanations that use different, but compatible, mathematical entities. The compatibility of these explanations prevents IBE from establishing platonism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"Josh"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-015-0667-7","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00003","page":"451-467","source":"Springer Link","title":"Indispensability and the problem of compatible explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0667-7","volume":"193"},
  {"id":"Hyde2018","abstract":"The sorites paradox originated in an ancient puzzle that appears to begenerated by vague terms, viz., terms with unclear(“blurred” or “fuzzy”) boundaries ofapplication. ‘Bald’, ‘heap’,‘tall’, ‘old’, and ‘blue’ areprime examples of vague terms: no clear line divides people who arebald from people who are not, or blue objects from green (hence notblue), or old people from middle-aged (hence not old). Because thepredicate ‘heap’ has unclear boundaries, it seems that nosingle grain of wheat can make the difference between a number ofgrains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,since one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that twograins do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. Thisreasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains ofwheat make a heap. , The same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. DorothyEdgington observes:, The puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modusponens: , The argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning fromapparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can berun equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that onemillion grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, thenone million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less onegrain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.It follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thussoritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains makea heap and that any number of grains make a heap., What conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is theresomething wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use ofvague predicates really lead to absurdity?[1] In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all thetime, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,most theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,i.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discoverthe defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attemptsto solve it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyde","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Raffman","given":"Diana"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Summer 2018","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Sorites Paradox","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/sorites-paradox/"},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting \"subjective statistical mechanics,\" the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaynes","given":"E.

  {"id":"Kadanoff2013","abstract":"The renormalization method is specifically aimed at connecting theories describing physical processes at different length scales and thereby connecting different theories in the physical sciences. The renormalization method used today is the outgrowth of 150 years of scientific study of thermal physics and phase transitions. Different phases of matter show qualitatively different behaviors separated by abrupt phase transitions. These qualitative differences seem to be present in experimentally observed condensed-matter systems. However, the “extended singularity theorem” in statistical mechanics shows that sharp changes can only occur in infinitely large systems. Abrupt changes from one phase to another are signaled by fluctuations that show correlation over infinitely long distances, and are measured by correlation functions that show algebraic decay as well as various kinds of singularities and infinities in thermodynamic derivatives and in measured system parameters. Renormalization methods were first developed in field theory to get around difficulties caused by apparent divergences at both small and large scales. However, no renormalization gives a fully satisfactory formulation of field theory. The renormalization (semi-)group theory of phase transitions was put together by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1971 based upon ideas of scaling and universality developed earlier in the context of phase transitions and of couplings dependent upon spatial scale coming from field theory. Correlations among regions with fluctuations in their order underlie renormalization ideas. Wilson's theory is the first approach to phase transitions to agree with the extended singularity theorem. Some of the history of the study of these correlations and singularities is recounted, along with the history of renormalization and related concepts of scaling and universality. Applications, particularly to condensed-matter physics and particle physics, are summarized.

Thus, one can use braid theory to study knot theory and vice versa. In this book, the author generalizes braid theory to dimension four. He develops the theory of surface braids and applies it to study surface links. In particular, the generalized Alexander and Markov theorems in dimension four are given. This book is the first to contain a complete proof of the generalized Markov theorem. Surface links are studied via the motion picture method, and some important techniques of this method are studied. For surface braids, various methods to describe them are introduced and developed: the motion picture method, the chart description, the braid monodromy, and the braid system. These tools are fundamental to understanding and computing invariants of surface braids and surface links. Included is a table of knotted surfaces with a computation of Alexander polynomials. Braid techniques are extended to represent link homotopy classes. The book is geared toward a wide audience, from graduate students to specialists.

I ask whether the relation between explanations at different theoretical levels should be thought of wholly in terms of abstraction, and argue that changes of the quantities in terms of which we describe a system can lead to novel explanations that are not merely abstractions of some more detailed picture. I use the example of phase transitions as described by statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to illustrate this, and to demonstrate some details of the relationship between abstraction, idealization, and novel explanation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Knox","given":"Eleanor"}],"container-title":"Noûs","DOI":"10.1111/nous.12120","ISSN":"1468-0068","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"00024 \n_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nous.12120","page":"41-60","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Abstraction and its Limits: Finding Space For Novel Explanation","title-short":"Abstraction and its Limits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nous.12120","volume":"50"},

Given the initial conditions of a particular type, the Cauchy problem may have an infinite set of solutions. Therefore, random behavior of closed classical systems is indeed possible.

Using this formalism, we relate the operator approach of Messiah and Greenberg (1964) to the configuration space approach pioneered by Souriau (1967), Laidlaw and DeWitt-Morette (1971), Leinaas and Myrheim (1977), and others.

Physically, however, we show that the corresponding particle states may always be realized in terms of bosons and/or fermions with an unobserved internal degree of freedom (although based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this conclusion is analogous to the rigorous results of the Doplicher–Haag–Roberts analysis in algebraic quantum field theory, as well as to the heuristic arguments which led Gell-Mann and others to qcd (i.e. Quantum Chromodynamics)).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Landsman","given":"N.

It is shown that on a continuous interval of its spectrum every Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space of one degree of freedom is a generalized coordinate with a conjugate generalized momentum. Every continuous spectral interval of a Hermitian operator is the limit of a discrete spectrum in the same interval. This result is applied to description of the state of a system by a statistical operator p($$\\hat q$$) following measurement of the probabilities of the eigenvalues of an observable$$\\hat q$$. Each continuous interval in the spectrum of$$\\hat q$$is replaced by a discrete spectrum in the same interval with a parameterK; the limitK → ∞ in which the spectrum becomes continuous is not attainable physically. In the linear vector space of a quantum mechanical system every continuous interval in the spectra of the observables is similarly replaced by a discrete spectrum with a finite parameter: it is a space of discrete bases and a set of such parameters.

In the present study, participants had to complete a lexical decision task that was set up to assess whether aggressive words were detected faster in the presence of alcohol-related pictures compared to neutral pictures. The results of this study did not replicate the expected finding as only a main effect of word type was found in which participants detected neutral words faster than aggressive words.

  {"id":"Liggins2016","abstract":"There has been much discussion of the indispensability argument for the existence of mathematical objects. In this paper I reconsider the debate by using the notion of grounding, or non-causal dependence. First of all, I investigate what proponents of the indispensability argument should say about the grounding of relations between physical objects and mathematical ones. This reveals some resources which nominalists are entitled to use.

  {"id":"Mainwood2006","abstract":"This thesis gives a philosophical assessment of a contemporary movement, influential amongst physicists, about the status of microscopic and macroscopic properties.  The fountainhead for the movement was a short 1972 paper `More is Different', written by the condensed-matter physicist, Philip Anderson.  Each of the chapters is concerned with themes mentioned in that paper, or subsequently expounded by Anderson and his followers.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I aim to locate Anderson's existence claims for `emergent properties' within the metaphysical, epistemological and methodological doctrines that identify themselves as `emergentist'.  I argue, against the commentators' consensus, that the New Emergentists make claims about the metaphysical status of physical properties, and should not be read as concerned only with matters of research methodology for physics.\n\nIn Chapter 2, I look at the physical examples that the New Emergentists appeal to, and propose a way of formulating their main claims within modern analytic metaphysics.  I argue that it is possible to view their thesis as an updated version of `British Emergentism' a movement popular in the early years of the twentieth century.  I support this contention by comparing examples of emergent properties put forward by the British and the New Emergentists.\n\nChapter 3 is a discussion of the significance of renormalisation techniques.  I attack a set of claims by Robert Batterman, who presents renormalisation as an explanatory strategy unrecognised by the philosophy of science.  I separate several different methods of renormalisation analysis, and argue that he has conflated them.  \n\nIn Chapter 4, I discuss the theoretical representation of phase transitions in condensed matter physics; in particular, their appeal to the limit of an infinite system.  I examine and refute various claims to the effect that the ineliminability of this limit in modelling phase transitions is of great metaphysical significance.  I suggest a definition of phase transitions for finite systems that dissolves this illusion, and gives us reason to trust the results of the theories that only apply in the infinite limit.  %I then comment on the significance of these results for a suggestion of Laura Ruetsche, that quantum statistical mechanics should be used as a guide to the interpretation of quantum field theory.\n\nChapter 5 revisits the doctrines of the New Emergentists in order to place their views within some wider philosophical debates.  I look at how their doctrines bear on issues in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of science.  I close by returning to the context within physics, in which the New Emergentists originally made their presence felt: the controversy over whether elementary particle physics should enjoy greater status than other areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mainwood","given":"Paul"}],"genre":"Published Article or Volume","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","note":"00043","source":"philsci-archive.pitt.edu","title":"Is More Different?

  {"id":"Matsuno2016","abstract":"Electron transport coupled with magnetism has attracted attention over the years. Among them, recently discovered is topological Hall effect (THE), originating from scalar spin chirality, that is, the solid angle subtended by the spins. THE is found to be a promising tool for probing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and consequent magnetic skyrmions. This interaction arises from broken inversion symmetry and hence can be artificially introduced at interface; this concept is lately verified in metal multilayers. However, there are few attempts to investigate such DM interaction at interface through electron transport. We clarified how the transport properties couple with interface DM interaction by fabricating the epitaxial oxide interface. We observed THE in epitaxial bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and paramagnetic SrIrO3 over a wide region of both temperature and magnetic field. The magnitude of THE rapidly decreases with the thickness of SrRuO3, suggesting that the interface DM interaction plays a significant role. Such interaction is expected to realize a 10-nm-sized Néel-type magnetic skyrmion. The present results established that the high-quality oxide interface enables us to tune the effective DM interaction; this can be a step toward future topological electronics.\nElectronic transport measurements reveal the formation of swirling spin textures, skyrmions, at high-quality oxide interface.\nElectronic transport measurements reveal the formation of swirling spin textures, skyrmions, at high-quality oxide interface.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Matsuno","given":"Jobu"},{"family":"Ogawa","given":"Naoki"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Kenji"},{"family":"Kagawa","given":"Fumitaka"},{"family":"Koshibae","given":"Wataru"},{"family":"Nagaosa","given":"Naoto"},{"family":"Tokura","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Kawasaki","given":"Masashi"}],"container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1600304","ISSN":"2375-2548","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e1600304","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"advances.sciencemag.org","title":"Interface-driven topological Hall effect in SrRuO3-SrIrO3 bilayer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/7/e1600304","volume":"2"},

We prove that this constant can be taken arbitrarily between 0 and 1. This solves a problem formulated by I. M. Gelfand in 1953. Moreover, we extend the notion of negligibility by allowing the constant to depend on the size of the cube. We give a complete description of all negligibility conditions of this kind.

Unlike many things claimed emergent by philosophers (e.g., tables and chairs), the alleged emergence of phase transitions stems from both philosophical and scientific arguments. Here we focus on the case for emergence built from physics, in particular, arguments based upon the infinite idealization invoked in the statistical mechanical treatment of phase transitions.  After teasing apart several challenges, we defend the idea that phase transitions are best thought of as conceptually novel, but not ontologically or explanatorily irreducible to finite physics; indeed, by looking at ongoing work on “smooth phase transitions” we even suggest that they’re not even conceptually novel. In the case of renormalization group theory, consideration of infinite systems and their singular behavior provides a central theoretical tool, but this is compatible with an explanatory reduction. Phase transitions may be “emergent” in some sense of this protean term, but not in a sense that is incompatible with the reductionist project broadly construed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Menon","given":"Tarun"},{"family":"Callender","given":"Craig"}],"genre":"Preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,19]]},"language":"en","note":"00053","source":"philsci-archive.pitt.edu","title":"Turn and Face the Strange...

After a careful analysis of EHRENFEST’s notebooks, correspondence, and publications, we conclude that the essential points of EHRENFEST’s paper were not perceived to a large extent, and hence that its implications were not considered thoroughly. Specifically, we show that EHRENFEST contributed significantly to the clarifications of the differences between PLANCK’s and EINSTEIN’s respective quantum hypotheses, as well as to those of the concepts ‘‘discontinuity,’’ ‘‘quantization,’’ and ‘‘corpuscularity.’’","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Navarro","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Pérez","given":"Enric"}],"container-title":"Archive for History of Exact Sciences","container-title-short":"Arch.

In addition to consideringthe selective publication of results, I argue that we need to also consider the selective publicationof epistemic by-products—observations and knowledge that scientists accumulate incidentallyin the process of carrying out their work. There are three reasons why we should be concernedabout the exclusion of epistemic by-products from the published literature: first, because theyplay an important role in robust replication attempts; second, because their absence can resultin misplaced scientific certainty; and third, because they contribute to a holistic understandingof natural phenomena. However, identifying and addressing publication bias against epistemicby-products and other undervalued forms of knowledge is more difficult than identifying biasagainst quantitative findings.

We supplement this criterion with our own brand of metaphysics, 'Aristotelian realism', in order to identify the truthmakers of mathematics.

Hence, arguing whether IA is sound results in wondering whether the schema admits such an interpretation. We discuss in full details all the parameters on which the specification of the general schema may depend. In doing this, we consider how different versions of IA can be obtained, also through different specifications of the notion of indispensability. We then distinguish between schematic and genuine IA, and argue that no genuine (non-vacuously and non-circularly) sound IA is available or easily forthcoming.

  {"id":"Pataut2016","abstract":"The author of “Parsimony and inference to the best mathematical explanation” argues for platonism by way of an enhanced indispensability argument based on an inference to yet better mathematical optimization explanations in the natural sciences. Since such explanations yield beneficial trade-offs between stronger mathematical existential claims and fewer concrete ontological commitments than those involved in (as it were) merely good mathematical explanations, one must countenance the mathematical objects that play a theoretical role in them via an application of the relevant mathematical results. The nominalist’s challenge is thus to undermine the platonistic force of such explanations by way of alternative nominalistic ones. The author’s contention is that such nominalistic explanations should provide a paraphrase of the proofs of the mathematical results being applied. There are reasons to doubt that proofs, construed here as formal derivations, actually contribute to the platonistc force to be undermined and, by parity, that nominalized proofs should bear responsability for the corresponding undermining. A discussion of two examples (Baker’s magicicadas, the hexagonal shape of honeycombs) and of associated arguments by Lange, Pincock, Steiner and Tallant, point to a a wealth of worries concerning the construal of this explanatory role. Among those figure the distinction between the weak and strong role of proofs, the distinction between causal or “ordinary” explanations and genuine mathematical ones, and the unifying role of optimization explanations. More generally, the very idea that the explanatory advantages yielded by applied mathematical claims may be construed as gradual or progressive and the associated notion that the feasibility of their nominalistic paraphrases decreases as the generality and force of these claim increases, deserves a closer attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pataut","given":"Fabrice"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-015-0706-4","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00001","page":"351-363","source":"Springer Link","title":"Comments on “Parsimony and inference to the best mathematical explanation”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0706-4","volume":"193"},

Offering a radically new conception of the role of data in the scientific modeling process as well as a new awareness of the problematic aspects of data, this cutting-edge volume offers a multifaceted view on experiments as designed and shaped in interaction with the modeling process. Contributors address such issues as the construction of models in conjunction with scientific experimentation; the status of measurement and the function of experiment in the identification of relevant parameters; how the phenomena under study are reconceived when accounted for by a model; and the interplay between experimenting, modeling, and simulation when results do not mesh. Highlighting the mediating role of models and the model-dependence (as well as theory-dependence) of data measurement, this volume proposes a normative and conceptual innovation in scientific modeling--that the phenomena to be investigated and modeled must not be precisely identified at the start but specified during the course of the interactions arising between experimental and modeling activities.

But this is the search for the underpinning of what Brown and Uffink (2001) have dubbed the ‘minus first law’ of thermodynamics. In contrast, the second law tells us that certain interventions on equilibrium states render the initial state ‘irrecoverable’. In this paper, I discuss the unusual nature of processes in thermodynamics, and the type of irreversibility that the second law embodies. I then search for the microscopic underpinning or statistical mechanical ‘reductive basis’ of the second law of thermodynamics by taking a functionalist strategy. First, I outline the functional role of the thermodynamic entropy: for a thermally isolated system, the thermodynamic entropy is constant in quasi-static processes, but increasing in non-quasi-static processes. I then search for the statistical mechanical quantity that plays this role — rather than the role of the traditional ‘holy grail’ as described by Callender (1999). I argue that in statistical mechanics, the Gibbs entropy plays this role.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Robertson","given":"Katie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,16]]},"language":"en","note":"00000","title":"In Search of the Holy Grail: How to Reduce the Second Law of Thermodynamics","title-short":"In Search of the Holy Grail","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/17516/"},

But recently, much more complicated systems, such as quantum fields and the infinite systems at the thermodynamic limit of quantum statistical mechanics, have attracted, and repaid, philosophical attention. Interpreting Quantum Theories has three entangled aims. The first is to guide those familiar with the philosophy of ordinary QM into the philosophy of 'QM infinity', by presenting accessible introductions to relevant technical notions and the foundational questions they frame. The second aim is to develop and defend answers to some of those questions. Does quantum field theory demand or deserve a particle ontology? How (if at all) are different states of broken symmetry different? And what is the proper role of idealizations in working physics? The third aim is to highlight ties between the foundational investigation of QM infinity and philosophy more broadly construed, in particular by using the interpretive problems discussed to motivate new ways to think about the nature of physical possibility and the problem of scientific realism.","author":[{"family":"Ruetsche","given":"Laura"}],"event-place":"Oxford, New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-953540-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,2]]},"number-of-pages":"398","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, New York","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"Interpreting Quantum Theories","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Sen2008","abstract":"This paper addresses the doubts voiced by Wigner about the physical relevance of the concept of geometrical points by exploiting some facts known to all but honored by none: Almost all real numbers are transcendental; the explicit representation of any one will require an infinite amount of physical resources. An instrument devised to measure a continuous real variable will need a continuum of internal states to achieve perfect resolution. Consequently, a laboratory instrument for measuring a continuous variable in a finite time can report only a finite number of values, each of which is constrained to be a rational number. It does not matter whether the variable is classical or quantum-mechanical. Now, in von Neumann’s measurement theory (von Neumann, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Princeton University Press, Princeton, [1955]), an operator A with a continuous spectrum—which has no eigenvectors—cannot be measured, but it can be approximated by operators with discrete spectra which are measurable. The measurable approximant F(A) is not canonically determined; it has to be chosen by the experimentalist. It is argued that this operator can always be chosen in such a way that Sewell’s results (Sewell in Rep. Math. Phys. 56: 271, [2005]; Sewell, Lecture given at the J.T. Lewis Memorial Conference, Dublin, [2005]) on the measurement of a hermitian operator on a finite-dimensional vector space (described in Sect. 3.2) constitute an adequate resolution of the measurement problem in this theory. From this follows our major conclusion, which is that the notion of a geometrical point is as meaningful in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as it is in classical physics. It is necessary to be sensitive to the fact that there is a gap between theoretical and experimental physics, which reveals itself tellingly as an error inherent in the measurement of a continuous variable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"R.

  {"id":"Shackel2007","abstract":"The principle of indifference is supposed to suffice for the rational assignation of probabilities to possibilities. Bertrand advances a probability problem, now known as his paradox, to which the principle is supposed to apply; yet, just because the problem is ill-posed in a technical sense, applying it leads to a contradiction. Examining an ambiguity in the notion of an ill-posed problem shows that there are precisely two strategies for resolving the paradox: the distinction strategy and the well-posing strategy. The main contenders for resolving the paradox, Marinoff and Jaynes, offer solutions which exemplify these two strategies. I show that Marinoff's attempt at the distinction strategy fails, and I offer a general refutation of this strategy. The situation for the well-posing strategy is more complex. Careful formulation of the paradox within measure theory shows that one of Bertrand's original three options can be ruled out but also shows that piecemeal attempts at the well-posing strategy will not succeed. What is required is an appeal to general principle. I show that Jaynes's use of such a principle, the symmetry requirement, fails to resolve the paradox; that a notion of metaindifference also fails; and that, while the well-posing strategy may not be conclusively refutable, there is no reason to think that it can succeed. So the current situation is this. The failure of Marinoff's and Jaynes's solutions means that the paradox remains unresolved, and of the only two strategies for resolution, one is refuted and we have no reason to think the other will succeed. Consequently, Bertrand's paradox continues to stand in refutation of the principle of indifference.","author":[{"family":"Shackel","given":"Nicholas"}],"container-title":"Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1086/519028","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,4,1]]},"note":"00000","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Bertrand’s Paradox and the Principle of Indifference","type":"article-journal","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"Shech2015b","abstract":"This dissertation concerns the philosophical underpinnings of representation and idealization in science. I begin by looking at the philosophical debate revolving around phase transitions and use it as a foil to bring out what I take to be most interesting about phase transitions, namely, the manner by which they illustrate the problem of essential idealizations. I continue to solve the problem in several steps. First, I conduct an interdisciplinary comparative study of different types of representations (e.g., mental, linguistic, pictorial) and consequently promote a content-based account of scientific representation intended to accommodate the practice of idealization and misrepresentation. I then critically asses the literature on idealizations in science in order to identify the manner by which to justify appeals to idealizations in science, and implement such techniques in two case studies that merit special attention: the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the quantum Hall effects. I proceed to offer a characterization of essential idealizations meant to alleviate the woes associated with said problem, and argue that particular types of idealizations, dubbed pathological idealizations, ought to be dispensed with. My motto is that idealizations are essential to explanation and representation, as well as to methodology and pedagogy, but they essentially misrepresent. Implications for the debate on platonism about mathematical objects are outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Shech","given":"Elay"}],"genre":"University of Pittsburgh ETD","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,23]]},"language":"en","note":"00002","number-of-pages":"286","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh","source":"d-scholarship.pitt.edu","title":"Assume a spherical cow: studies on representation and idealization","title-short":"Assume a spherical cow","type":"webpage","URL":"http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/24941/"},

Consequently, it is shown that the existence and uniqueness of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators in quantum mechanics have important implications for philosophical issues. Also, the alleged indispensable explanatory role of said idealizations is examined via a minimal model explanatory scheme.

  {"id":"Sober1980","abstract":"Ernst Mayr has argued that Darwinian theory discredited essentialist modes of thought and replaced them with what he has called \"population thinking\". In this paper, I characterize essentialism as embodying a certain conception of how variation in nature is to be explained, and show how this conception was undermined by evolutionary theory. The Darwinian doctrine of evolutionary gradualism makes it impossible to say exactly where one species ends and another begins; such line-drawing problems are often taken to be the decisive reason for thinking that essentialism is untenable. However, according to the view of essentialism I suggest, this familiar objection is not fatal to essentialism. It is rather the essentialist's use of what I call the natural state model for explaining variation which clashes with evolutionary theory. This model implemented the essentialist's requirement that properties of populations be defined in terms of properties of member organisms. Requiring such constituent definitions is reductionistic in spirit; additionally, evolutionary theory shows that such definitions are not available, and, moreover, that they are not needed to legitimize population-level concepts. Population thinking involves the thesis that population concepts may be legitimized by showing their connections with each other, even when they are not reducible to concepts applying at lower levels of organization. In the paper, I develop these points by describing Aristotle's ideas on the origins of biological variation; they are a classic formulation of the natural state model. I also describe how the development of statistical ideas in the 19th century involved an abandoning of the natural state model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sober","given":"Elliott"}],"container-title":"Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1086/288942","ISSN":"0031-8248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1980,9,1]]},"note":"00677","page":"350-383","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Evolution, Population Thinking, and Essentialism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/288942","volume":"47"},

Vagueness and vague experiences can structure material categorisations of the world; it can contribute to the shaping of social relations and nurture the appreciation of difficult experiences. However, the recent archaeological (re)turn to science as the main provider of knowledge of the past renders vagueness futile as an empirical occurrence through its exorcism of elusiveness and ambiguity in the notorious pursuit of absolute, exact and quantifiable facts. This article challenges the pursuit and use of exact data in archaeological science and the consequential implications of the omission of vague occurrences, discussing the problem that ambiguous and absent evidence become neglected in subsequent conclusion. Second, it is demonstrated that vagueness and ambiguity can be integral to certain social and material phenomena. Third, the article examines recent archaeological analyses of burial practices in South Scandinavian passage graves from the Middle Neolithic in order to discuss the pursuit of certitude in archaeological observations and interpretations.

  {"id":"Tang2019","abstract":"The discovery of the quantum Hall effect (QHE)1,2 in two-dimensional electronic systems has given topology a central role in condensed matter physics. Although the possibility of generalizing the QHE to three-dimensional (3D) electronic systems3,4 was proposed decades ago, it has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of the 3D QHE in bulk zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) crystals. We perform low-temperature electric-transport measurements on bulk ZrTe5 crystals under a magnetic field and achieve the extreme quantum limit, where only the lowest Landau level is occupied, at relatively low magnetic fields. In this regime, we observe a dissipationless longitudinal resistivity close to zero, accompanied by a well-developed Hall resistivity plateau proportional to half of the Fermi wavelength along the field direction. This response is the signature of the 3D QHE and strongly suggests a Fermi surface instability driven by enhanced interaction effects in the extreme quantum limit. By further increasing the magnetic field, both the longitudinal and Hall resistivity increase considerably and display a metal–insulator transition, which represents another magnetic-field-driven quantum phase transition. Our findings provide experimental evidence of the 3D QHE and a promising platform for further exploration of exotic quantum phases and transitions in 3D systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Fangdong"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Yafei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Peipei"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Ruidan"},{"family":"Schneeloch","given":"John"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shengyuan A."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Patrick A."},{"family":"Gu","given":"Genda"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Zhenhua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liyuan"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1180-9","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7757","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"language":"en","number":"7757","page":"537-541","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group; https://web.archive.org/web/20210601124619/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1180-9","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Three-dimensional quantum Hall effect and metal–insulator transition in ZrTe 5","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1180-9","volume":"569"},

  {"id":"Uffink1995","abstract":"The principle of maximum entropy is a general method to assign values to probability distributions on the basis of partial information. This principle, introduced by Jaynes in 1957, forms an extension of the classical principle of insufficient reason. It has been further generalized, both in mathematical formulation and in intended scope, into the principle of maximum relative entropy or of minimum information. It has been claimed that these principles are singled out as unique methods of statistical inference that agree with certain compelling consistency requirements. This paper reviews these consistency arguments and the surrounding controversy. It is shown that the uniqueness proofs are flawed, or rest on unreasonably strong assumptions. A more general class of inference rules, maximizing the so-called Rényi entropies, is exhibited which also fulfill the reasonable part of the consistency assumptions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Uffink","given":"Jos"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1016/1355-2198(95)00015-1","ISSN":"1355-2198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,12,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00189","page":"223-261","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Can the maximum entropy principle be explained as a consistency requirement?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1355219895000151","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"Uffink1996","abstract":"The principle of maximum entropy is a method for assigning values to probability distributions on the basis of partial information. In usual formulations of this and related methods of inference one assumes that this partial information takes the form of a constraint on allowed probability distributions. In practical applications, however, the information consists of empirical data. A constraint rule is then employed to construct constraints on probability distributions out of these data. Usually one adopts the rule that equates the expectation values of certain functions with their empirical averages. There are, however, various other ways in which one can construct constraints from empirical data, which makes the maximum entropy principle lead to very different probability assignments. This paper shows that an argument by Jaynes to justify the usual constraint rule is unsatisfactory and investigates several alternative choices. The choice of a constraint rule is also shown to be of crucial importance to the debate on the question whether there is a conflict between the methods of inference based on maximum entropy and Bayesian conditionalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Uffink","given":"Jos"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1016/1355-2198(95)00022-4","ISSN":"1355-2198","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,3,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00094","page":"47-79","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The constraint rule of the maximum entropy principle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1355219895000224","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"Uffink2001","abstract":"The aim of this article is to analyse the relation between the second law of thermodynamics and the so-called arrow of time. For this purpose, a number of different aspects in this arrow of time are distinguished, in particular those of time-reversal (non-)invariance and of (ir)reversibility. Next I review versions of the second law in the work of Carnot, Clausius, Kelvin, Planck, Gibbs, Carathéodory and Lieb and Yngvason, and investigate their connection with these aspects of the arrow of time. It is shown that this connection varies a great deal along with these formulations of the second law. According to the famous formulation by Planck, the second law expresses the irreversibility of natural processes. But in many other formulations irreversibility or even time-reversal non-invariance plays no role. I therefore argue for the view that the second law has nothing to do with the arrow of time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Uffink","given":"Jos"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1016/S1355-2198(01)00016-8","ISSN":"1355-2198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,9,1]]},"language":"en","note":"00000","page":"305-394","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Bluff your way in the second law of thermodynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219801000168","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"vanRiel2019","abstract":"The English verb ‘reduce’, derives from the Latin‘reducere’, whose literal meaning ‘to bringback’, informs its metaphorical use in philosophy. If oneasserts that the mental reduces to the physical, that heat reduces tokinetic molecular energy, or that one theory reduces to anothertheory, one implies that in some relevant sense the reduced theory canbe brought back to the reducing theory, the mental can bebrought back to the physical, or heat can be broughtback to molecular kinetic energy. The term‘reduction’ as used in philosophy expresses the idea thatif an entity x reduces to an entity y then y isin a sense prior to x, is more basic thanx, is such that x fully depends upon it or isconstituted by it. Saying that x reduces to ytypically implies that x is nothing more than yor nothing over and above y., Though the term ‘reduction’ in this use may not correspondto everyday use nor to scientific discourse, its technical meaning isnot fixed by mere stipulation. ‘Reduction’ is a term ofnatural language, and, building upon its common metaphoric meaningphilosophers use it to designate relations of particular philosophicalimportance in a number of closely related fields, especially in thephilosophy of science, the philosophy of mind, and metaphysics., The notion of scientific reduction as used in contemporaryanalytic philosophy differs from conceptions of reduction according towhich we learn about the instantiation of reduction-relations on apurely a priori basis from basic religious, metaphysical orepistemological principles. ‘Scientific reduction’ appliesto reductionist claims supposedly justified by scientific evidence andthe success of science., Different accounts of scientific reduction have shaped debates aboutdiverse topics including scientific unification, the relation between(folk-)psychology and neuroscience, themetaphysics of the mind, the status of biology vis àvis chemistry, and the relation between allegedly teleologicalexplanations and causal explanations. Understanding the relevantnotions is thus a prerequisite for understanding key issues incontemporary analytic philosophy. Moreover, the notion of reductionitself has become a target of recent philosophical discussion,especially in the philosophy of science and in metaphysics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Riel","given":"Raphael","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Van Gulick","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Spring 2019","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"note":"00099","publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Scientific Reduction","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/scientific-reduction/"},
  {"id":"vanStrien2015","abstract":"The development of rigorous foundations of differential calculus in the course of the nineteenth century led to concerns among physicists about its applicability in physics. Through this development, differential calculus was made independent of empirical and intuitive notions of continuity, and based instead on strictly mathematical conditions of continuity. However, for Boltzmann and Poincaré, the applicability of mathematics in physics depended on whether there is a basis in physics, intuition or experience for the fundamental axioms of mathematics—and this meant that to determine the status of differential equations in physics, they had to consider whether there was a justification for these mathematical continuity conditions in physics. For this reason, their ideas about continuity and discreteness in nature were entangled with epistemology and philosophy of mathematics. They reached opposite conclusions: Poincaré argued that physicists must work with a continuous representation of nature, and thus with differential equations, while Boltzmann argued that physicists must ultimately take nature to be discrete.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Strien","given":"Marij","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-015-0701-9","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3275-3295","source":"Springer Link","title":"Continuity in nature and in mathematics: Boltzmann and Poincaré","title-short":"Continuity in nature and in mathematics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0701-9","volume":"192"},
  {"id":"vanWierst2019","abstract":"The paradox of phase transitions raises the problem of how to reconcile the fact that we see phase transitions happen in concrete, finite systems around us, with the fact that our best theories—i.e. statistical-mechanical theories of phase transitions—tell us that phase transitions occur only in infinite systems. In this paper we aim to clarify to which extent this paradox is relative to the mathematical framework which is used in these theories, i.e. classical mathematics. To this aim, we will explore the philosophical consequences of adopting constructive instead of classical mathematics in a statistical-mechanical theory of phase transitions. It will be shown that constructive mathematics forces certain ‘de-idealizations' of such theories: talk of actually infinite systems is meaningless, there are no discontinuous functions, and—in a sense which will be clarified—constructive real numbers reflect our imperfect methods of determining the values of physical quantities. As such, so it will be argued, constructive mathematics offers a means to gain insight in the idealizations introduced in classical theories and the philosophical issues surrounding them.","author":[{"family":"Wierst","given":"Pauline","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-017-1637-z","ISSN":"15730964","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"page":"1863–1884","title":"The paradox of phase transitions in the light of constructive mathematics","type":"article-journal","volume":"196"},

  {"id":"Varzi2015","abstract":"We think of a boundary whenever we think of an entity demarcated fromits surroundings. There is a boundary (a line) separating Maryland andPennsylvania. There is a boundary (a circle) isolating the interior ofa disc from its exterior. There is a boundary (a surface) enclosingthe bulk of this apple. Sometimes the exact location of a boundary isunclear or otherwise controversial (as when you try to trace out themargins of Mount Everest, or even the boundary of your ownbody). Sometimes the boundary lies skew to any physical discontinuityor qualitative differentiation (as with the border of Wyoming, or theboundary between the upper and lower halves of a homogeneoussphere). But whether sharp or blurry, natural or artificial, for everyobject there appears to be a boundary that marks it off from the restof the world. Events, too, have boundaries — at least temporalboundaries. Our lives are bounded by our births and by our deaths; thesoccer game began at 3pm sharp and ended with the referee's finalwhistle at 4:45pm. It is sometimes suggested that even abstractentities, such as concepts or sets, have boundaries of their own, andWittgenstein could emphatically proclaim that the boundaries of ourlanguage are the boundaries of our world (1921: 5.6). Whether all thisboundary talk is coherent, however, and whether it reflects thestructure of the world or simply the organizing activity of our mind,are matters of deep philosophical controversy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Varzi","given":"Achille"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2015","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"note":"00072","publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Boundary","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/boundary/"},
  {"id":"VASCONEZ2006","abstract":"The paper investigates two questions, namely: the nature, and the cause of the soritical transition, which is claimed to be constitutive of fuzziness. First an argument is presented to the effect that there is prima facie evidence that the soritical series is incompatible with a transition from one opposite to the other. Then two positions are critically reviewed: nihilism and discontinuism (two of whose varieties are the so-called epistemicism and supervaluationism). Both are found wanting in that none has adequate answers to our two queries. Finally a solution is developed which accommodates the graduality of the transition, and its contradictoriality. Thus a contradictorial gradualism is shown to be all that is demanded to account for the phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"VÁSCONEZ","given":"MARCELO"}],"container-title":"Logique et Analyse","ISSN":"0024-5836","issue":"195","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"271-306","source":"JSTOR","title":"CONTRADICTORIAL GRADUALISM VS.

  {"id":"Wayne2012","abstract":"Recent work by Robert Batterman and Alexander Rueger has brought attention to cases in physics in which governing laws at the base level “break down” and singular limit relations obtain between base- and upper-level theories. As a result, they claim, these are cases with emergent upper-level properties. This paper contends that this inference—from singular limits to explanatory failure, novelty or irreducibility, and then to emergence—is mistaken. The van der Pol nonlinear oscillator is used to show that there can be a full explanation of upper-level properties entirely in base-level terms even when singular limits are present. Whether upper-level properties are emergent depends not on the presence of a singular limit but rather on details of the ampliative approximation methods used. The paper suggests that focusing on explanatory deficiency at the base level is key to understanding emergence in physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wayne","given":"Andrew"}],"container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-010-9817-0","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"341-356","source":"Springer Link","title":"Emergence and singular limits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-010-9817-0","volume":"184"},

  {"id":"Zeh2010","abstract":"I review arguments demonstrating how the concept of “particle” numbers arises in the form of equidistant energy eigenvalues of coupled harmonic oscillators representing free fields. Their quantum numbers (numbers of nodes of the wave functions) can be interpreted as occupation numbers for objects with a formal mass (defined by the field equation) and spatial wave number (“momentum”) characterizing classical field modes. A superposition of different oscillator eigenstates, all consisting of n modes having one node, while all others have none, defines a non-degenerate “n-particle wave function”. Other discrete properties and phenomena (such as particle positions and “events”) can be understood by means of the fast but continuous process of decoherence: the irreversible dislocalization of superpositions. Any wave-particle dualism thus becomes obsolete. The observation of individual outcomes of this decoherence process in measurements requires either a subsequent collapse of the wave function or a “branching observer” in accordance with the Schrödinger equation—both possibilities applying clearly after the decoherence process. Any probability interpretation of the wave function in terms of local elements of reality, such as particles or other classical concepts, would open a Pandora’s box of paradoxes, as is illustrated by various misnomers that have become popular in quantum theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeh","given":"H.
